___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

Etiological factors include: trauma, infections with bacteria, fungi, virus protozoa, systemic collagen vascular diseases and unknown, idiopathic causes. The most frequent cause for acute anterior uveitis is idiopathic. The classical five symptoms of acute anterior uveitis are: pain, redness, watering, photophobia and blurring of vision. The typical findings include circumcorneal congestion, keratic precipitates, miosis, anterior chamber cells, flare, fibrin, hypopyon, posterior synechiae and anterior vitreous cells.

General medical history: empty. 
Ocular medical history: photophobia, and pain.
Major complaint: sudden onset decrease in vision
Methods:
Colour Photography  Anterior Segment, SL-OCT 
Findings:
Colour Photography  Anterior Segment, before intracameral air injection: massive stromal edema due to leakage of aqueous through a tear in descemet membrane. 
SL-OCT, before intracameral air injection: Descemet's membrane detachment with dilaceration of collagen lamellae with large fluid-filled intrastromal cavity.
Colour Photography  Anterior Segment , 15 days after intracameral air injection: no stromal edema, posterior displacement of the hyperreflective structures with increased epithelial thickening and stromal thinning. 
Discussion:
Sandali et al. (1) proposed a Fourier-domain OCT classification containing 5 distinct keratoconus stages. Stage 1 demonstrates thinning of apparently normal epithelial and stromal layers at the conus. Stage 2 demonstrates hyperreflective anomalies occurring at the Bowman's layer level with epithelial thickening at the conus. Stage 3 demonstrates posterior displacement of the hyperreflective structures occurring at the Bowman's layer level with increased epithelial thickening and stromal thinning. Stage 4 demonstrates pan-stromal scar. Stage 5 demonstrates hydrops; 5a, acute onset: Descemet's membrane rupture and dilaceration of collagen lamellae with large fluid-filled intrastromal cysts; 5b, healing stage: pan-stromal scarring with a remaining aspect of Descemet's membrane rupture. 
Miyata et al. (2) found, that the intracameral air injection is a useful therapy to shorten the period of corneal edema in acute hydrops secondary to keratoconus. He reported that the average period of persistence of corneal edema was 20 days in the intracameral air injection group and 65 days in the control group.

Patient: 54 years of age, male; BCVA
General medical history: empty. 
Ocular medical history: photophobia, and pain.
Major complaint: sudden onset decrease in vision
Methods:
Colour Photography  Anterior Segment, SL-OCT 
Findings:
Colour Photography  Anterior Segment, before intracameral air injection: massive stromal edema due to leakage of aqueous through a tear in descemet membrane. 
SL-OCT, before intracameral air injection: Descemet's membrane detachment with dilaceration of collagen lamellae with large fluid-filled intrastromal cavity.
Colour Photography  Anterior Segment , 15 days after intracameral air injection: no stromal edema, posterior displacement of the hyperreflective structures with increased epithelial thickening and stromal thinning. 
Discussion:
Sandali et al. (1) proposed a Fourier-domain OCT classification containing 5 distinct keratoconus stages. Stage 1 demonstrates thinning of apparently normal epithelial and stromal layers at the conus. Stage 2 demonstrates hyperreflective anomalies occurring at the Bowman's layer level with epithelial thickening at the conus. Stage 3 demonstrates posterior displacement of the hyperreflective structures occurring at the Bowman's layer level with increased epithelial thickening and stromal thinning. Stage 4 demonstrates pan-stromal scar. Stage 5 demonstrates hydrops; 5a, acute onset: Descemet's membrane rupture and dilaceration of collagen lamellae with large fluid-filled intrastromal cysts; 5b, healing stage: pan-stromal scarring with a remaining aspect of Descemet's membrane rupture. 
Miyata et al. (2) found, that the intracameral air injection is a useful therapy to shorten the period of corneal edema in acute hydrops secondary to keratoconus. He reported that the average period of persistence of corneal edema was 20 days in the intracameral air injection group and 65 days in the control group.

The reflected light from the glass leaded to a bilateral exposure of the macula. Two months later without any systemic therapy we found an instrinsic repair. 
General Medical History: empty.
Main Complant: decreased vision after exposure to a green laser pointer.
Purpose: to present instrinsic repair of Laser pointer maculopathy. 
Methods: Colour Image Posterior Pole, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography  OCT, Fluorescein angiography FFA
Findings:
Colour Image Posterior Pole: just after laser exposure yellowish round spot in the foveal area.
Colour Image Posterior Pole: two months after laser exposure partial resolution yellowish round spot, persistent alterations at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium.
OCT: just after laser exposure disruption of the external limiting membrane, impairment of photoreceptor zone of the inner segments, and interdigitation zone.
OCT: two months after laser exposure partial resolution of the outer retinal disruption compared to initial visit with persistent, small foveal photoreceptor defects, residual disruption of the outer retinal layer at the fovea remained unchanged.
FFA: two months after laser exposure increased central avascular zone, late ill-defined leakage. 
Discussion: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 4 major classes of lasers (I–IV), of which the laser pointers belong to class IIIA (1). Diode laser pointers of red–orange (633–650 nm wavelength) are safer than the green–blue (400–500 nm). Injuries to the eye can occur within few seconds when the exposed to class III lasers that emit up to 5 mW power. Hossein et al. (2) reported, that after treatment with a systemic high-dose corticosteroid the initially visible hyperreflective band in the foveal region disappeared.

General Medical History: kidney transplantion in 2001, taking oral cellsept, steroids immediately prior to presentation at 10.4.2016 with acute post transplant lymphoproliferative disease and deterioration of vision in OD.
Ocular Medical History: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis or acute retinal necrosis (ARN) was suspected at 10.4.2016. Cytomegali virus (CMV) was detected in the anterior chamber, intravenous course of acyclovir was initiated.
Purpose: to show effect of systemic therapy with acyclovir over 4 months in Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome in Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole, initial finding: small Kyrieleis’ plaques within the arteries, retinal infiltration , retinal vasculitis, vitreous opacity, 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole, after 4 months of therapy with aciclovir:  retinal vasculitis with Kyrieleis’ plaques within mainly all arteries, retinal necrosis. 
OCT, after 4 months of therapy with aciclovir: retinal necrosis, Kyrieleis’ plaques within the arteries.

Discussion: Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome in CMV retinitis is typical for immuno-compromised patients. Bonfioli et al. (1) summarize d, that acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is an uncommon intraocular inflammatory syndrome characterized by severe and diffuse uveitis, retinal vasculitis, and retinal necrosis. It occurs in immunocompetent patients, and can also be found in immunocompromised subjects. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV 1 and 2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been implicated in the etiology of ARN. The characteristic features  include iridocyclitis, vitritis, retinal necrosis, and retinal vasculitis with Kyrieleis’ vasculitis (2). Kyrieleis’ vasculitis is a condition in which white-yellowish exudates are placed in a beaded pattern within the retinal arteries. The diagnosis of ARN is usually based in clinical features. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in aqueous humor samples is useful to identify the etiology of the disease. The treatment of ARN includes intravenous acyclovir, corticosteroids and aspirin. To prevent fellow eye involvement, intravenous acyclovir is followed by oral acyclovir for 14 weeks. Alternatives to acyclovir include ganciclovir, foscarnet, famcyclovir, brivudine, and valgancyclovir.

FFA: small focal hyperfluorescence in the area of the  hypofluorescent lesion, peripheral multifocal choroiditis with multifocal  leakages, diffuse late macular edema, papillary leakage, 
SD-OCT: cystoid macular edema, epiretinal gliosis. small amount of subretinal fluid.
Discussion:
Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis (ASPPC) is a rare manifestation of syphilis. (1-3) Fundus and angiographic changes in ASPPC may mimic other chorioretinal diseases, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigmentepitheliopathy (APMPPE).  It was  suggested that inflammation-associated perfusion abnormalities of the choriocapillaris contribute to the pathophysiological process. Most cases respond to systemic treatment of the underlying Treponema pallidum infection.

Patient: 25 years of age, male, BCVA 0.4 at OD, 0.2 at OS.
General Medical History: major electrical injury (3000 V)  in July 2013 with skin burns on the face, neck, hand, and inner left arm.
Ocular Medical History: 12 months later development of cataract in both eyes with decreased visual acuity. 
Purpose: to present electrically induced cataract in both eyes induced by high voltage current.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, VEP.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: cataractous changes with characteristic anterior subcapsular opacifications.
VEP: decreased amplitude in OS, regular amplitude in OD.
Discussion: 
Saffle et al. reviewed patients suffering major electrical injuries. Patients who suffered cataracts were injured with high (greater than 1,000-v) voltage current. All patients suffered true 'entrance and exit' wounds. Cataracts first presented as decreased visual acuity 1 to 12 months postinjury. Electrical cataracts remain a serious potential complication of electrical injury.

Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis was confirmed on temporal artery biopsy. 
General medical history: headache.
Purpose: to present anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in both eyes in giant cell arteritis.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Segment OD: papilloedema, diffuse swelling, blurred border, no hemorrhage around the disc rim.
Colour Photography Posterior Segment OS: sectoral swelling and blurred border at 6h, no hemorrhage around the disc rim.
OCT OD: diffused optic disc swelling with almost total disappearance of the physiological cup, ONH fiber crowding. 
OCT OS: sectorial peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer edema at 6h. 

Discussion:
Arteritis temporalis shows a variable course of the disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss. Hayeh et al. (1) reported, that patients with giant cell arteritis presented a variety of ocular symptoms : visual loss of varying severity in 98%, amaurosis fugax in 31%, diplopia in 6%, and eye pain in 8%. Because giant cell arteritis is a potentially blinding disease and its early diagnosis is the key to preventing blindness, it is important to recognize its various ocular manifestations. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ infarction (2).

Patient: 55 years of age, male, BCVA  0.1 at OD , 1.0 at OS, IOP 10/10 mmHg under topical medication.
___General Medical History: aortic valve insufficiency, arterial hypertension. 
___Ocular Medical History: acute increase of intraocular pressure with values of 40 mmHg with glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy, followed by an incomplete central  retinal vein occlusion with cystoid macular edema,  and an intravitreal  antiVEGF-injection. 
___Main Complaint: decline of visual acuity at OD.
___Purpose: to present asymmetric macular capillary rarefication shown by OCT-angiography.
___Methods: colour photography posterior pole, Triton OCT-angiography, Triton OCT, visual field. 
___Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole, OD: pale optic nerve atrophy, focal retinal hemorrhages.
Visual field, OD: concentric visual field defect.
Triton OCT, OD:  thinning of retinal nerve layer.
Triton, OCT-angiography, OD : increased diameter of foveolar avascular Zone.
Triton, OCT-angiography, Mosaic OD & OS: in OD increased diameter of foveolar avascular zone compared to OS with regular foveolar avascular zone.
___Discussion:  In presented case the increased foveolar avascular zone and the rarefication of macular capillaries  in OD may be caused by the venous vascular dysregulation, and glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy. Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy with optic nerve deterioration, visual field defects, and vascular dysregulation and rarefication. Müller et al. and Zivkovicet al. investigated macular capillaries in glaucoma by OCT-angiography. Zivkovic M et al. (2) measured foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in NTG and healthy subjects. He reported that mean horizontal, mean vertical diameter, and FAZ area were significantly enlarged in the NTG group. Müller et al. (1)  investigated central macular microvasculature in glaucoma patients. He found in perimetric glaucoma patients significantly reduced density maps of superficial foveal flow.

General Medical History: empty.
Ocular Medical History: The patient slowly developed 3 mm of well-tolerated relative proptosis with minimal motility disturbance at OS, no visual decline. 
Main Complaint: proptosis with motility disturbance.
Methods: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visual evoked response (VEP).
Findings: 
(1) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an intraconal rounded mass that perfused slowly, the anterior surface was well circumscribed. There was no compression of the optic nerve.
(2) VEP of OS showed regular latencies with attenuated amplitudes at OS.
Discussion: Bonavolontà  et al. (1) evaluated the frequencies of orbital space-occupying lesions. In this retrospective case series, the authors reviewed 2,480 consecutive patients. Of the 2,480 lesions, 68% were benign and 32% were malignant. The most frequent benign tumors were dermoid cyst (14%) and cavernous hemangioma (9%). The most common malignant tumors were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (12%), basal cell carcinoma (3%), and orbital metastases (3%). Cavernous hemangioma only exceptionally compresses the optic nerve.

General Medical History: empty.
Ocular Medical History: deterioration of visual acuity at OD since 3 weeks.
Main Complaint: metamorphopsia at OD.
Purpose: to present retinal changes in Best's vitelliform Dystrophy.
Methods: Colour Fundus Images, Image Fundus Autofluorescence (HE), SD-OCT (HE), Fluorescein Angiography FFA (HE), Electro-oculogram EOG. 
Findings:
Colour fundus images: presenting deposits of lipofuscin on Bruch's membrane and a scarring of the macula.
OCT:  showing deposits of lipofuscin on Bruch's membrane (*), correlating with lipofuscin and melanofuscin granulae in the RPE. Photoreceptor layer has lost the outer segments (#). 
Image fundus autofluorescence: localised areas of hyperfluorescence centrally in the fovea depicting lipofuscin accumulation in the RPE.
Electro-oculogram EOG: showing reduced Arden ratio of 1.16 at OD and 1.1 at OS.
Fluorescein Angiography FFA (HE): showing rarefication of foveolar capillaries, no leakage of RPE.

Discussion:
Best's disease is a hereditary affection with juvenile onset. The fundus may present various stages. In a paper of Lorenz and Preising (1) relevant data are summarized . They showed, that advanced stages discloses deposits of lipofuscin on Bruch's membrane, correlating with lipofuscin and melanofuscin granulae in the RPE. Photoreceptors have lost the outer segments. Usually the loss of function correlates with a reduced Arden ratio of the electro-oculogram. They stated, that Best's disease is caused by mutations in VMD2 (hBEST1), producing Bestrophin, which is a regulatory part of a Ca(2+) channel or Cl(-)channel.

Findings: 
SD-OCT: in 01/2015 acute serous retinal detachment in OD and OS. 
SD-OCT: in 04/2015 in OS macular pigmentepithel proliferation, no serous retinal detachment in OD and OS. The initial finding with serous retinal detachment has spontaneously resolved.

Discussion: Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity across the world. This condition complicates approximately 3% to 7% of pregnancies, and the severe form affects 0.6% to 1.2% of pregnancies. Preeclampsia can cause grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy with hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, hard exudates in the macular region, and swelling of the optic disks. The severe preeclampsia variant, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), occurs in approximately 20-25% of women with severe preeclampsia . It is named not only for the liver involvement but also for the disorder of the coagulation system which develops. Approximately 20% of women with HELLP syndrome develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, which carries a poor prognosis for both mother and fetus. Conditions other than preeclampsia can cause serous retinal detachments and choroidal thickening. Central serous retinopathy is hypothesized to be due to an overactivation of mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in the choroidal vasculature.

Discussion:
The Swedish Thalidomide Study (1987–1989) [1-4] described the ophthalmologic findings of thalidomide-exposed embryos: incomitant strabismus, usually of the Duane type, aberrant tearing, coloboma, microphthalmia, and facial nerve palsy. Thalidomide [α-(N-phthalimido)-glutarimide] was synthesized in 1954 under the brand name of Contergan. Thalidomide was a popular treatment for anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and hyperemesis. Thalidomide is an extremely potent teratogenic drug capable of causing severe systemic malformations to an exposed fetus during the sensitive period. In addition to limb anomalies, craniofacial anomalies, ocular motility dysfunction and structural eye malformations were reported. Approximately 5000 cases of malformed live births occurred worldwide. The survival rate of thalidomide-exposed embryos was estimated to be between 40 and 50%. More than 10 000 pregnancies may have been affected. Thalidomide caused malformations primarily between 20 and 36 days after fertilization.

Findings:

SD-OCT of OD: margin of choroidal coloboma appearance of a hump owing to inward turning of the retinochoroidal layers, no thickening of the layers at the margin.
Discussion: Ocular coloboma is a common malformation. It includes a spectrum of anomalies that ranges from iris coloboma to clinical anophthalmos. Coloboma is etiologically heterogeneous. The spectrum  can vary from small colobomas located in the equatorial region that do not interfere with vision, to large colobomas involving the disc and macula with severe impairment of vision. Choroidal coloboma is a congenital defect caused by defective closure of embryonal fissure, which normally takes place during the 6th week of gestation. As an isolated defect, it is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs (1, 3). Gopal L et al. (2) described choroidal colobomas. Genetic as well as environmental causes have been proposed to cause an intrauterine insult that can lead to defective closure of the embryonal fissure leading to coloboma of the fundus (3). Histologically, the colobomatous area is deficient in normal choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and the retina.

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm. 
Symptomatic choroidal metastases is a rare presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Choroidal metastases (CM) are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. CM is detected in 2% to 7% of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is generally discovered at the end-stage of the disease. Singh et al. (2) reported the demographic profile, histology, disease stage, ocular and lung lesions, diagnostic and treatment (systemic and ocular) modalities, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer : 67% of patients were male and 78% were current or ex-smokers, mean age was 55 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type followed by squamous and small cell. Bilateral involvement was rare (<10%). Ocular treatment modalities included radiation, enucleation, and systemic steroids. Regression of choroidal metastases with treatment was observed in 67% of patients who did not undergo enucleation.

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm. 
Symptomatic choroidal metastases is a rare presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Choroidal metastases (CM) are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. CM is detected in 2% to 7% of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is generally discovered at the end-stage of the disease. Singh et al. (2) reported the demographic profile, histology, disease stage, ocular and lung lesions, diagnostic and treatment (systemic and ocular) modalities, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer : 67% of patients were male and 78% were current or ex-smokers, mean age was 55 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type followed by squamous and small cell. Bilateral involvement was rare (<10%). Ocular treatment modalities included radiation, enucleation, and systemic steroids. Regression of choroidal metastases with treatment was observed in 67% of patients who did not undergo enucleation.

Right eye has band keratopathy, and poliosis of one lash, the left eye is phthisical. In view of the history of preceding surgery and the poliosis this is most likely a case of sympathetic Ophthalmia, but could also be a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Syndrome. The final diagnosis can only be made by histological investigation. One should also suspect a malignant melanoma. Careful ultrasound examinations  are needed to rule out this possibility.

General Medical History: in 06/2011 acute myeloic leucemia (AML M4) with 126.000 leucocytes, coronary heart disease, cranial MRI without lesions, Hb 9.3 g/dl. In 10/2011 beginn of systemic therapy with Adriamycin, Cytrarabin, and Mitoxatron. In 11/2011 due to thrombophlebitis and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli antibiotic therapy with meropenem (Meronem®, vancomycin und linezolid (Zyvoxid®) over three weeks. 
Ocular Medical History: in 01/2012 fast reduction of VA at OS after systemic therapy over three weeks with meropenem (Meronem®, vancomycin und linezolid (Zyvoxid®).
Main Complaint: reduction of VA in OS.
Findings:
1) Colour Photography: bilateral optic nerve atrophy (OS>OD).
2) VEP: decreased amplitudes und prolonged latencies.
3) OCT: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.
Discussion:
It was reported (1,2), that antibiotic therapy with Linezolid (Zyvoxid®) can cause optic nerve atrophy. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, used against infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may lead to progressive, potentially irreversible neuropathies of the optic nerve especially in long-time application.
Linezolid is part of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal initiation complex. Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

Discussion:
Ectopia lentis classically presents with a preceding history of blunt ocular trauma, or it may be associated with other ocular disorders such as congenital glaucoma and aniridia, or concomitant hereditary systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria. Ectopia lentis is a condition in which the crystalline lens is displaced from its normal position in the eye. A zonular weakening occurs in conjunction with a systemic disease like Homocystinuria or Marfan syndrome. Normal levels of plasma homocysteine are between 5–15 µmol/l l and concentrations between 16–30 µmol/l is mild, 31- 100nmol/ml is moderate, and greater than 100 µmol/l  is severe hyperhomocystinuria. Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by inborn error of metabolism due to deficiency of cystathionine beta synthase resulting in systemic accumulation of homocysteine and methionine and causing multisystem disorder of connective tissues, muscles, nervous system, and cardiovascular system. In European populations, prevalence of homocystinuria is around 1 in 10.000. In the presented case we found a level of plasma homocysteine of 11.5 µmol/l.

Discussion:
It is recognized that significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss occurs in MS patients following optic neuritis. A reduction in RGC may be identified earlier due to transient edema in the acute stage of ON masking any early RNFL loss. Several recent studies (1, 2) have suggested that RGC layer thinning is a good measure of disease-related visual and general disability and brain atrophy. Ocular manifestations of Von Recklinghausen disease are frequent and can reveal the disease. Benchekroun O et al. (3) examined 11 patients with Neurofibromatosis during two years. He suggested that an ophthalmologic examination must always be performed if Von Recklinghausen is suspected.

Main Complaints: dark spots in central visual field
Methods: Colour Photography.
Findings:
Colour Photography: multiple white-centred retinal haemorrhages scattered in the posterior poles of both eyes
Discussion:
Roth spots (white-centred retinal haemorrhages) were classically described as septic emboli lodged in the retina of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis. More recent histological evidence suggests, that they are not foci of bacterial abscess. They are nonspecific and may be found in many other diseases. A variety of insults can result in retinal capillary rupture. It was suggested by (1) and others, that in subacute bacterial endocarditis a low grade disseminated intravascular coagulopathy predisposes to capillary bleeding in the retinal vasculature. White-centred haemorrhage results from the rupture of retinal capillaries and the extrusion of whole blood. Subsequent platelet adhesion to damaged endothelium and the platelet release reaction initiates the coagulation cascade,  that results in the formation of a platelet-fibrin thrombus. Morphologically, this fibrin thrombus appears as a pale white lesion in the centre of the haemorrhage. White-centred haemorrhages are observed, can be subclassified according to common underlying mechanisms resulting in capillary rupture.

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

Patient: 13 years of age, male, BCVA 0.4 at OD, 0.9 at OS.
General Medical History: new onset, single episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure , MRI showed unclear cerebral tumor.
Ocular Medical History: up to the time of presentation no subjective problems with vision.

Purpose: to show bitemporal and diffuse optic nerve atrophy in suspected central neurocytoma after a new onset, single episode of generalized seizure.
       
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, SD-OCT, Visual Field, cMRI.
Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: regular optic nerve head in OD and OS.
SD-OCT: diffuse and temporally decreased retinal nerve fiber thickness in OD>OS
Visual Field: hemianopsia at OD, complete visual field defect at OS. 
Cranial MRI: Coronal T1-weighted and (B) sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showing  cystic frontobasal and suprasellar lesion with intra- and extraventricular parts with increased T2-signal, no contrast media uptake and no diffusion restriction. Only slight perifocal edema. The maximal extent is 68 x 43 x 58 mm. In summary, this lesion is most likely a central neurocytoma.
Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) enables mapping of retinal vascular layers and visualizing nonperfused areas. OCT-A is effective for evaluation of macular complications of RVO. Suzuki et al. (1) evaluating the retinal hemodynamics noninvasively by OCTA found that anti-VEGF therapy improved the retinal deep ischemia in RVOs.

Patient: 91 years of age, male, BVAC 0.1 at OD.
General Medical History: empty. 
Ocular Medical History: Due to cataract in 03/2013 uncomplicated phacoemulsification with insertion of a foldable hydrophilic acrylic single-piece intraocular lens which resulted in good postoperative vision. After some weeks deterioration of visual acuity.
Main complaint: decrease of vision.
Methods: colour photography.
Findings: fibrosis as well as phimosis of the anterior capsular opening. The capsulorhexis opening is oval-shaped, reducing the best-corrected visual acuity to 0.1. Posterior capsular opacification is not present
Diskussion:
It was reported (1), that anterior capsular opacification (ACO) or capsular contraction syndrome (CCS) is a known complication of continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC). Histopathologic studies have shown that anterior capsular opacification is due to lens epithelial cell metaplasia. Contact with intraocular lens biomaterial causes lens epithelial cells to undergo myofibroblastic changes and to produce extracellular matrix components. Suggested risk factors for ACO and membrane growth include pseudoexfoliation syndrome, advanced age, diabetes mellitus, uveitis, myopia, pigmentary retinal degeneration, capsulorhexis size, and IOL design and material. The contraction may cause decentration of the IOL.

Discussion:
Retinal arterial occlusions (CRAO) occurs secondary to an emboli, which may originate from atheromatous plaques in the ascending aorta or carotid arteries, as well as calcified heart valves. Brown et al. (1) reviewed a series of 107 cases with central retinal artery occlusions (CRAO). 26% showed a  macular sparing owing to a patent cilioretinal artery. Patients with patent cilioretinal sparing regained variable degrees of visual acuity. CRAO without cilioretinal sparing rarely regained any useful vision.

An estimated 92 million new cases of Chlamydia trachomatis infection occur each year (1). About 0.3%-2% of genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis are complicated by a chlamydial eye infection (2). Ocular localizations of C. trachomatis are typically observed among neonates and infants who acquire the infection while passing through the birth canal. Chlamydial conjunctivitis may also occur in adolescents following a genital infection. Chlamydial conjunctivitis affects initially one eye and the incubation period varies from 4 to 12 days. Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) are currently recommended as the first diagnostic choice.

and the neurosensory retina, causing a ‘bull’s eye’ pattern of depigmentation
of the macula, and subsequent central visual loss. The cumulative dosis for a chloroquine retinopathy is about 100g.

Patient: 59 years of age, BCVA 0,5pp at OD, 0.8 at OS, IOP 16/ 14 mmHg, relative afferent pupillary defect at OD. 
Ocular Medical History: acute blurry vision in the right eye.
General Medical History: Arterial hypertension with blood pressure of 240/ 160 mmHg.
Purpose: to present hypertensive choroidopathy with Elschnig spots in arterial hypertension.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT, Indocyanine Green Angiography.
Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots), retinal edema, narrowed arterioles, arterio-venous crossing, no retinal hemorrhages.
Indocyanine Green Angiography, after 2 min: multifocal areas with choriocapillaris non-perfusion.
Mosaic Image: Colour Photography Posterior Segment & Indocyanine Green Angiography: hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots areas) corresponding with areas of choriocapillaris non-perfusion.
OCT: focal thickening of retinal nerve fiber layer, intraretinal irregularities, no serous retinal detachment.
Discussion: Ocular manifestations of systemic hypertension are common and result in vascular compromise at the level of the retina, the choroid, or the optic nerve. Hypertensive choroidopathy is caused by fibrinoid necrosis of the choroidal arterioles. Hypertensive choroidopathy is characterized by hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris, break down of the retinal pigment epithelial cells, and hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots). Hypertensive choroidopathy is a complication of systemic hypertension and can be the harbinger of a life-threatening hypertensive emergency.

Discussion:
The Swedish Thalidomide Study (1987–1989) [1-4] described the ophthalmologic findings of thalidomide-exposed embryos: incomitant strabismus, usually of the Duane type, aberrant tearing, coloboma, microphthalmia, and facial nerve palsy. Thalidomide [α-(N-phthalimido)-glutarimide] was synthesized in 1954 under the brand name of Contergan. Thalidomide was a popular treatment for anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and hyperemesis. Thalidomide is an extremely potent teratogenic drug capable of causing severe systemic malformations to an exposed fetus during the sensitive period. In addition to limb anomalies, craniofacial anomalies, ocular motility dysfunction and structural eye malformations were reported. Approximately 5000 cases of malformed live births occurred worldwide. The survival rate of thalidomide-exposed embryos was estimated to be between 40 and 50%. More than 10 000 pregnancies may have been affected. Thalidomide caused malformations primarily between 20 and 36 days after fertilization.

Discussion: Ocular coloboma is a common malformation. It includes a spectrum of anomalies that ranges from iris coloboma to clinical anophthalmos. Coloboma is etiologically heterogeneous. The spectrum  can vary from small colobomas located in the equatorial region that do not interfere with vision, to large colobomas involving the disc and macula with severe impairment of vision. Choroidal coloboma is a congenital defect caused by defective closure of embryonal fissure, which normally takes place during the 6th week of gestation. As an isolated defect, it is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs (1, 3). Gopal L et al. (2) described choroidal colobomas. Genetic as well as environmental causes have been proposed to cause an intrauterine insult that can lead to defective closure of the embryonal fissure leading to coloboma of the fundus (3). Histologically, the colobomatous area is deficient in normal choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and the retina.

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm. 
Symptomatic choroidal metastases is a rare presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Choroidal metastases (CM) are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. CM is detected in 2% to 7% of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is generally discovered at the end-stage of the disease. Singh et al. (2) reported the demographic profile, histology, disease stage, ocular and lung lesions, diagnostic and treatment (systemic and ocular) modalities, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer : 67% of patients were male and 78% were current or ex-smokers, mean age was 55 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type followed by squamous and small cell. Bilateral involvement was rare (<10%). Ocular treatment modalities included radiation, enucleation, and systemic steroids. Regression of choroidal metastases with treatment was observed in 67% of patients who did not undergo enucleation.

Discussion:
Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked retinal dystrophy belonging to the family of blinding disorders. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. CHM is caused by mutations in the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1) gene, which encodes a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (1). Complete deletion of the CHM gene causes severe choroideremia. Mura et al. (2) presented results of serial ERGs documenting progression first of rod and then of cone disease.

https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/photo.jsf?node=9099&locale=en,Christmas tree cataract,"The Christmas tree cataract is highly reflective, iridescent and polychromatic. They look like little needles in the eye going in all directions and assume the shape of a Christmas tree. The needles change color when the angle of the incident light is changed. In Christmas tree cataract,the adjacent areas of the lens remain clear.

It has been said that with increasing age there is degradation of the peptides and amino acids within the lens by endopeptidases. There is an increase in calcium ions and this local increase in calcium ions stimulates the endopeptidases resulting in protein breakdown. The breakdown products are subsequently deposited in the lumen of the reticular meshwork forming the Christmas tree cataract. The crystals are thus taken to be made of cystine (an amino acid). Accumulation of cystine beyond the point of crystallization causes the formation of needles that gives the fascinating appearance of the Christmas tree in the eye.

Ocular medical history: slow decrease of vision in OS.

General medical history: stenosis of ispilateral internal carotid artery, stroke in 2005. 

Main complaint: glare and decrease of vision at OS. 

Methods: colour photography.

Findings: 
Colour photography showed highly refractile multicolored ""needles"" crisscrossing the lens fibers. 

Discussion:
Christmas tree cataract consists of highly refractile multicolored ""needles"" crisscrossing the lens fibers of the deep cortex. The fact that the colors vary according to the angle of the incident light, and that in retroillumination only a dim outline of the cataract is seen, would suggest that Christmas tree cataract is a diffractive phenomenon. In a study 8 lenses with Christmas tree cataract were investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (1). They found that the needles are smooth, rectangular, plate-like elements bordered by membranes and amorphous material and running crisscross through the lens. The needles proved to be largely dissolved, but the remains showed regular spacings of approximately 5 nm. The needles have a high sulfur content and pronounced S-S, CS-SC, and C-S vibrations. The cytoplasm adjacent to the needles and reticular meshwork had an elevated Ca++ content. They concluded that cystine is the most likely candidate for the Christmas tree needles and that the needles probably are formed as the result of an age-related aberrant breakdown of crystallins induced by elevated Ca++ levels.

OCT: subretinal fluid, retinal exudation. 
Discussion:
Coats' disease (retinal telangiectasis) is a sporadic disorder characterized by a defect in retinal vascular development resulting in vessel leakage, subretinal exudation and retinal detachment. Black GC et al. (1) has indicated probable role of somatic mutation in the NDP gene in the pathogenesis of Coats' disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified (2) as a key regulator in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Coats' disease demonstrates vascular abnormalities, associated exudation, and manifests as teleangiectasia and aneurysms. Exudative subretinal lipid deposits can be extensive. Coats' disease is unilateral and affects predominantly healthy young males. Joussen AM (3) suggested that Coats' disease as a progressive disease requires lifelong follow-up and therapy. Treatment consisted of cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation and bevacizumab intravitreal injection.

___Discussion:  In presented case the increased foveolar avascular zone and the rarefication of macular capillaries  in OD may be caused by the venous vascular dysregulation, and glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy. Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy with optic nerve deterioration, visual field defects, and vascular dysregulation and rarefication. Müller et al. and Zivkovicet al. investigated macular capillaries in glaucoma by OCT-angiography. Zivkovic M et al. (2) measured foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in NTG and healthy subjects. He reported that mean horizontal, mean vertical diameter, and FAZ area were significantly enlarged in the NTG group. Müller et al. (1)  investigated central macular microvasculature in glaucoma patients. He found in perimetric glaucoma patients significantly reduced density maps of superficial foveal flow.

Discussion:
Involvement of the optic nerve, either because of inflammation or increased intracranial pressure, is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease. Lesser reported (1) that the spirochete in Lyme disease invades the eye early and remains dormant. Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations include neuroretinitis, optic atrophy, disc edema, and involvement of multiple cranial nerves (seventh nerve paresis, Bell's palsy). Criteria for Lyme disease include the lack of evidence of other disease, other clinical findings consistent with Lyme disease, occurrence in patients living in an endemic area, positive serology, and, in most cases, response to treatment.

Discussion:
Congenital cataract is a leading cause of childhood blindness, accounting for 10~38% of blindness in children. The prevalence of congenital cataract is estimated to be 0.6~6 per 10,000 live births (1). Various etiological factors have been reported, including infection, neonatal asphyxia, malnutrition, and genetic defects. 8.3%~25% of congenital cataracts were inherited. Several genes have been identified to be associated with congenital cataracts, such as genes encoding crystallins, connexins and other membrane proteins, beaded filament proteins, growth and transcription factors, and others.
The crystallins are the main structural proteins of the eye lens (2). The alphaA-crystallin is a molecular chaperone. It is expressed mainly in the lens. Mutations in the Cryaa gene lead to recessive or dominant cataracts. Altered gamma-crystallins is a key event in cataract formation. Cataract formation, caused by Cryg mutations is characterized by stopping the secondary lens fiber differentiation as indicated by the presence of remnants of cell nuclei, which are usually degraded in secondary fiber cells. 
One of several molecular mechanism underlying the congenital hereditary cataract is caused by the recently characterized A2V mutation in βB2-crystallin. It was reported (3) that the tetramerization of βB2-crystallin was retarded by the A2V mutation. They showed, that the A2V-mutation slightly decreased the thermal stability and promoted the thermal aggregation of βB2-crystallin. A2V mutation lead to injury of lens optical properties by decreasing βB2-crystallin stability. The minor changes by the A2V mutation was consistent with the phenotype in the patients, who noticed their optical defects at the twenties. As age increased, damages in βB2-crystallin would accumulate by the unavoidable physical and chemical stresses. The slight decrease in thermal stability of the mutated βB2-crystallin finally led to the onset of cataract much earlier than normal people, but later than those highly harmful mutations.

Congenital cataract is a leading cause of childhood blindness, accounting for 10~38% of blindness in children. The prevalence of congenital cataract is estimated to be 0.6~6 per 10,000 live births (1). Various etiological factors have been reported, including infection, neonatal asphyxia, malnutrition, and genetic defects. 8.3%~25% of congenital cataracts were inherited. Several genes have been identified to be associated with congenital cataracts, such as genes encoding crystallins, connexins and other membrane proteins, beaded filament proteins, growth and transcription factors, and others.
The crystallins are the main structural proteins of the eye lens (2). The alphaA-crystallin is a molecular chaperone. It is expressed mainly in the lens.

https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/photo.jsf?node=9012&locale=en,"Conjunctival hyperemia, bilateral secondary to prostaglandin analog use for glaucoma","Prostaglandin analogs can be used for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma through the reduction of intraocular pressure.  Prostaglandins reduce the intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eye.  By reducing intraocular pressure, they suppress the effects of glaucoma.  Prostaglandins are administered through eye drop solution. 

A side effect of prostaglandin use is the development of conjunctival hyperemia.  Hyperemia is a condition in which there is an increase in blood flow to a specific part of the body, in this case, the sclera of the eye.  However, conjunctival hyperemia may be associated with wide range of ocular diseases, and can also be a response to allergic inflammation or irritation.  Therefore, it is important that a physician distinguish the underlying disorder before altering medication.

The incidence of hyperemia varies with the drug being utilized.  Latanaprost has exhibited an incidence of 5%-15%1, bimatoprost at 15%-45%2, and travoprost at 35%-50%3.  It is believed that prostaglandins cause the aqueous to utilize ocular circulation, resulting in the vasodilation observed.  It is important to note that these side effects often manifest at the beginning of treatment and usually return to baseline levels after a few weeks. This is most likely due to adaptation to the drug.  Therefore, patients who have had previous exposure to prostaglandins will probably respond with less hyperemia if another drug is prescribed.

Some of the other side effects of prostaglandins include blurred vision, a decrease in visual acuity, dry eyes, inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye, and skin rash or allergic skin reaction.  Itching, burning, and stinging during administration of the drug is also a common side effect.  Other less common side effects are cystoid macular edema, overgrowth of eyelashes, darkening of eyelid skin color,  and darkening of iris color.

This patient was switched to another brand of prostaglandin glaucoma drops because after several months, his conjunctival hyperemia would not improve.  This patient has primary open angle glaucoma, the number one type of glaucoma in African-Americans.

Discussion
Fuchs' corneal dystrophy - a dominantly inherited disorder -  is a slowly progressive, bilateral corneal dystrophy that affects corneal endothelial cells. 
Cataract surgery is a risk factor for corneal endothelial cell loss. Corneal endothelial cell loss, a major complication that sometimes occurs after cataract surgery, can lead to corneal edema and decompensation if cell density falls to 500 cells/mm2 or below. Yamazoe et al (1) reported that the mean rate of endothelial cell loss is about 12% ± 23%.  Seitzman  et al (2) reported a series of patients with Fuchs' dystrophy (136 eyes) undergoing cataract surgery. The average preoperative corneal thickness ranged from 482 to 674 µm. 37% had preoperative corneal thickness of 600 µm or thicker. Of eyes with preoperative pachymetry measurements of 600 µm or thicker, 10% progressed to penetrating keratoplasty. Patients with a preoperative corneal thickness of >640 μm had a 22.2% rate of requiring a corneal transplant. Their data suggest that current cataract removal techniques allow for excellent visual rehabilitation in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy who have a preoperative corneal thickness lower than 600 µm. They recommend a concurrent penetrating keratoplasty with cataract surgery in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy and a corneal thickness of >640 μm.

Discussion
Fuchs' corneal dystrophy - a dominantly inherited disorder -  is a slowly progressive, bilateral corneal dystrophy that affects corneal endothelial cells. 
Cataract surgery is a risk factor for corneal endothelial cell loss. Corneal endothelial cell loss, a major complication that sometimes occurs after cataract surgery, can lead to corneal edema and decompensation if cell density falls to 500 cells/mm2 or below. Yamazoe et al (1) reported that the mean rate of endothelial cell loss is about 12% ± 23%.  Seitzman  et al (2) reported a series of patients with Fuchs' dystrophy (136 eyes) undergoing cataract surgery. The average preoperative corneal thickness ranged from 482 to 674 µm. 37% had preoperative corneal thickness of 600 µm or thicker. Of eyes with preoperative pachymetry measurements of 600 µm or thicker, 10% progressed to penetrating keratoplasty. Patients with a preoperative corneal thickness of >640 μm had a 22.2% rate of requiring a corneal transplant. Their data suggest that current cataract removal techniques allow for excellent visual rehabilitation in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy who have a preoperative corneal thickness lower than 600 µm. They recommend a concurrent penetrating keratoplasty with cataract surgery in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy and a corneal thickness of >640 μm.

Only slight perifocal edema. The maximal extent is 68 x 43 x 58 mm. In summary, this lesion is most likely a central neurocytoma.

Patient: 13 years of age, male, BCVA 0.4 at OD, 0.9 at OS.
General Medical History: new onset, single episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure , MRI showed unclear cerebral tumor.
Ocular Medical History: up to the time of presentation no subjective problems with vision.

Purpose: to show bitemporal and diffuse optic nerve atrophy in suspected central neurocytoma after a new onset, single episode of generalized seizure.
       
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, SD-OCT, Visual Field, cMRI.
Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: regular optic nerve head in OD and OS.

Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

Visible effect of antiinflammatory therapy of cystoid macular edema (CME) after cataract surgery presented by OCT from February and March 2013: Disappearance of cystoid macular edema, persisting epiretinal membrane. Patient: 72 years of age, male; BCVA OS 0.1, nuclear cataract. Ocular medical history: deterioration of vision over two years, regular cataract surgery with small incision at February 4th 2013, no increase of BCVA in February 27th 2013 due to cystoid macular edema. Begin of therapy with oral carboanhydrase inhibitors (250mg/d), and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for three weeks. General medical history: rheumatoid arthritis, arterial hypertension. Main complaint: lack of improvement of vision after cataract surgery. Purpose: to show improvement of cystoid macular edema within four weeks under oral carboanhydrase inhibitors and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Method: Patient undergone spectralis-OCT before and after begin of therapy Findings: OCT from February 27th 2013: cystoid macular edema with epiretinal membrane. OCT from March 25th 2013: no cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane. Discussion: Suggested factors in CME after cataract surgery include hypotony, vitreous traction, and inflammation. There is the hypothesis, disruption of the BAB is a dominating factor in CME. It was suggested (1) that inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, which are biosynthesized by the anterior uvea and lens epithelial cells, are triggered by surgical trauma, leading to disruption of the BAB. As a result, various inflammatory mediators accumulate in the aqueous humor. The mediators are dispersed throughout the vitreous and increase the permeability of retinal vessels. The blood–retinal barrier (BRB) becomes disrupted, inducing CME over time. Predispositions to BAB and BRB disruption include aging, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and other diseases. Data (2) suggest that the inflammatory mediators increase in the aqueous for 1 to 2 weeks after cataract and IOL surgery. It was shown (3), that topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) prevents the spike-like increase of flare, implying that NSAIDs are more effective than steroidal agents in preventing postoperative inflammation. Nepafenac was more effective than fluorometholone in preventing CME and BAB disruption and in providing early recovery of vision. Literature: K.

Patient: 61 years of age, female, BCVA 0.2 at OD, 1.0 at OS, IOP 16/17mmHg.
Ocular Medical History: two months after erythema migrans blurred vision in left eye.
General Medical Information: in 2012 characteristic erythema migrans with positive Lyme antibody test, treatment  with doxycycline, months later development of optic nerve atrophy and prolonged central motor conduction time.
Purpose: to present unilateral optic nerve atrophy in suspected Lyme disease. 
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT), Visual Field, Visual Evoked Potential (VEP). 
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: pale optic nerve head, small retinal vessel diameter. 
SD-OCT: thinned retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.
VEP: decreased amplitude of evoked potential. 
Visual Field: concentric visual field loss.
Discussion:
Involvement of the optic nerve, either because of inflammation or increased intracranial pressure, is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease. Lesser reported (1) that the spirochete in Lyme disease invades the eye early and remains dormant. Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations include neuroretinitis, optic atrophy, disc edema, and involvement of multiple cranial nerves (seventh nerve paresis, Bell's palsy). Criteria for Lyme disease include the lack of evidence of other disease, other clinical findings consistent with Lyme disease, occurrence in patients living in an endemic area, positive serology, and, in most cases, response to treatment.

Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

Visual Field: parafoveal scotoma in the superior hemifield corresponding to the decreased RNFL thickness at the inferotemporal sector. 
Discussion: 
Choi et al. (1) reported that optic disc pits had a diverse structure according to the alteration of the lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue. Optic disc pit is often associated with a corresponding scotoma. Choi et al. (1) suggested, that a compliant lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue may become susceptible to the damaging effects of increased IOP values. The ongoing insult to the optic nerve may then influence the lamina cribrosa tissue or prelaminar tissue, exhibiting the appearance of alteration in the lamina cribrosa or or prelaminar tissue. Subsequently, the axons passing through the altered lamina cribrosa and or prelaminar tissue are likely to be damaged by loss of structural support, loss of nutrient supply from laminar capillaries, or loss of metabolic support from astrocytes.

Main Complaint: reduction of VA in OS.
Findings:
1) Colour Photography: bilateral optic nerve atrophy (OS>OD).
2) VEP: decreased amplitudes und prolonged latencies.
3) OCT: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.
Discussion:
It was reported (1,2), that antibiotic therapy with Linezolid (Zyvoxid®) can cause optic nerve atrophy. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, used against infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may lead to progressive, potentially irreversible neuropathies of the optic nerve especially in long-time application.
Linezolid is part of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal initiation complex. Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

Discussion:
It is recognized that significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss occurs in MS patients following optic neuritis. A reduction in RGC may be identified earlier due to transient edema in the acute stage of ON masking any early RNFL loss. Several recent studies (1, 2) have suggested that RGC layer thinning is a good measure of disease-related visual and general disability and brain atrophy. Ocular manifestations of Von Recklinghausen disease are frequent and can reveal the disease. Benchekroun O et al. (3) examined 11 patients with Neurofibromatosis during two years. He suggested that an ophthalmologic examination must always be performed if Von Recklinghausen is suspected.

Discussion: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of blindness in most industrialized nations. Diabetic macular  edema is characterised by exudative fluid accumulation in the macula. It affects one in 15 people with diabetes resulting in more than 20 million cases worldwide. Pathogenesis of DME is related to the breakdown of the blood–retina barrier, leaking microaneurysms , upregulated cytokine, and other factors. Enhanced expression of the proangiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A has been validated in patients with DME. Hasegawa N  et al. (1) demonstrated that the density of the microaneurysms in the deep capillary plexus (DCP)  was significantly associated with the macular edema volume and that microaneurysms contributed to the pathogenesis of DME.

Fluorescence Angiography in 2014: parafoveal leaking  microaneurysms, central retinal capillary leakage. 
Fluorescence Angiography in 2016: parafoveal leaking  microaneurysms, central retinal capillary leakage. 

SD-OCT in 2014: retinal thickening,  parafoveal hard exsudates,  cystoid spaces within 500 µm.
SD-OCT in 2016: no parafoveal hard exsudates, decreasing  cystoid spaces .

Discussion: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of blindness in most industrialized nations. Diabetic macular  edema is characterised by exudative fluid accumulation in the macula. It affects one in 15 people with diabetes resulting in more than 20 million cases worldwide. Pathogenesis of DME is related to the breakdown of the blood–retina barrier, leaking microaneurysms , upregulated cytokine, and other factors. Enhanced expression of the proangiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A has been validated in patients with DME. Hasegawa N  et al. (1) demonstrated that the density of the microaneurysms in the deep capillary plexus (DCP)  was significantly associated with the macular edema volume and that microaneurysms contributed to the pathogenesis of DME.

Patient: 63 years of age, female, BCVA 0.8 at OD, 0.9 at OS; 
General Medical History: two months before, in Nov 2013 acute infarction of posterior cerebral artery, long standing arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: regular pseudophakia.
Main Complaint: altered visual field to the left side.
Purpose: to demonstrate complete visual field defect to the left side after posterior cerebral artery infarction.
Methods: Colour Photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), ww-Perimetry (Octopus G1), MRT (Siemens, TimTrio). 
Colour Photography OD& OS: pale optic nerve head (OD>OS), no cupping.
OCT OD& OS : minimal diffuse thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer.
ww-Perimetry OD& OS : complete homonymus visual defect to the left side.
MRI: in 11/2013 complete infarction of posterior cerebral artery (T1) (star).
MRI-DTI: in 01/2014 decreased axonal integrity in posterior part of optic radiation (arrow). 
Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

PIO: 17/12 mmHg. Historia ocular: deterioro de la agudeza visual en OD de 3 semanas de evolución, y metamorfopsia.  La OCT muestra depósitos de lipofuscina  sobre la membrana de Bruch, quee se corelaciona con gránulos de lipofuscina y melanofuscina  en el EPR.

EOG: relación de Arden reducida:  1.16 en OD, y 1.1 en OS. Fluoresceinangiografía: rarefacción de los capilares foveolares, no fuga en el EPR.
Discusión: la Enfermedad de Best es una afección hereditaria de inicio en la edad juvenil. El fondo del ojo puede presentar distintos estadíos. En un trabajo de Lorenz y Preising (1) mostraron que los estadíos avanzados hay depósitos de lipofuscina en la membraba de Bruch, lo que se correlaciona con los gránulos de lipofucina y melanofucina en el EPR. Los fotoreceptores pierden los segmentos externos. Usualmente el compromiso funcional se correlaciona con una relación de Arden reduciada en el EOG. Ellos señaklan que la Enf. de Best es causada por una mutación en VMD2 (hBES 1), produciendo Bestrofina,  la cual es una parte reguladora  del Canal del Ca(2+) o el canal del Cl(-9.

In this photo, the Krimsky method is employed to measure the exotropia. The light reflex is almost centered with 45PD (Base inside), which is the extent of the horizontal prism bar shown. Some physicians also employ the MODIFIED Krimsky method where the prism is placed over the best or dominant eye. 
In this patient, using a 25 PD prism over EACH eye (50 PD in total), allowed for the light reflex to be perfectly centered (not shown in photo). Prism amounts can be added to each other when over each eye or a vertical and horizontal prism are stacked on top of each other but not when two horizontal or two vertical prisms are stacked on top of one eye.
The patient's vision is 20/25 OU. The patient complained of diplopia with prism correction greater than 40PD, suggesting a possible anomalous retinal correspondence (ARC). This can be assessed with various tests.","#Optho::Strabismus,OcularMotilityDisorders::Exodeviations::Case:DivergentConcomitantStrabismus",https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/atlasimg/1244844771349_low.jpg,"<img src=""7872.jpg"">"

This patient has Duane’s syndrome in the right eye and has had unknown prior strabismus surgery (which improved his adduction) and has a small residual XT, seen in primary position. He exhibits decreased abduction on both right and left gaze (some of this is likely a sequelae of the prior surgery).

Discussion: Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome in CMV retinitis is typical for immuno-compromised patients. Bonfioli et al. (1) summarize d, that acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is an uncommon intraocular inflammatory syndrome characterized by severe and diffuse uveitis, retinal vasculitis, and retinal necrosis. It occurs in immunocompetent patients, and can also be found in immunocompromised subjects. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV 1 and 2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been implicated in the etiology of ARN. The characteristic features  include iridocyclitis, vitritis, retinal necrosis, and retinal vasculitis with Kyrieleis’ vasculitis (2). Kyrieleis’ vasculitis is a condition in which white-yellowish exudates are placed in a beaded pattern within the retinal arteries. The diagnosis of ARN is usually based in clinical features. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in aqueous humor samples is useful to identify the etiology of the disease. The treatment of ARN includes intravenous acyclovir, corticosteroids and aspirin. To prevent fellow eye involvement, intravenous acyclovir is followed by oral acyclovir for 14 weeks. Alternatives to acyclovir include ganciclovir, foscarnet, famcyclovir, brivudine, and valgancyclovir.

Discussion: Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome in CMV retinitis is typical for immuno-compromised patients. Bonfioli et al. (1) summarize d, that acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is an uncommon intraocular inflammatory syndrome characterized by severe and diffuse uveitis, retinal vasculitis, and retinal necrosis. It occurs in immunocompetent patients, and can also be found in immunocompromised subjects. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV 1 and 2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been implicated in the etiology of ARN. The characteristic features  include iridocyclitis, vitritis, retinal necrosis, and retinal vasculitis with Kyrieleis’ vasculitis (2). Kyrieleis’ vasculitis is a condition in which white-yellowish exudates are placed in a beaded pattern within the retinal arteries. The diagnosis of ARN is usually based in clinical features. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in aqueous humor samples is useful to identify the etiology of the disease. The treatment of ARN includes intravenous acyclovir, corticosteroids and aspirin. To prevent fellow eye involvement, intravenous acyclovir is followed by oral acyclovir for 14 weeks. Alternatives to acyclovir include ganciclovir, foscarnet, famcyclovir, brivudine, and valgancyclovir.

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Ocular medical history: deterioration of vision over two years, regular cataract surgery with small incision at February 4th 2013, no increase of BCVA in  February 27th 2013 due to cystoid macular edema.  Begin of therapy with oral carboanhydrase inhibitors (250mg/d), and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for three weeks.    
General medical history: rheumatoid arthritis, arterial hypertension.
Main complaint: lack of improvement of vision after cataract surgery. 
Purpose: to show improvement of cystoid macular edema within four weeks under oral carboanhydrase inhibitors and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.     
Method: Patient undergone spectralis-OCT before and after begin of therapy
Findings: 
OCT from February 27th 2013: cystoid macular edema with epiretinal membrane. 
OCT from March 25th 2013: no cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane.
Discussion: Suggested factors in CME after cataract surgery include hypotony, vitreous traction, and inflammation. There is the hypothesis, disruption of the BAB is a dominating factor in CME. It was suggested (1) that inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, which are biosynthesized by the anterior uvea and lens epithelial cells, are triggered by surgical trauma, leading to disruption of the BAB. As a result, various inflammatory mediators accumulate in the aqueous humor. The mediators are dispersed throughout the vitreous and increase the permeability of retinal vessels. The blood–retinal barrier (BRB) becomes disrupted, inducing CME over time. Predispositions to BAB and BRB disruption include aging, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and other diseases.
Data (2) suggest that the inflammatory mediators increase in the aqueous for 1 to 2 weeks after cataract and IOL surgery. 
It was shown (3), that topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) prevents the spike-like increase of flare, implying that NSAIDs are more effective than steroidal agents in preventing postoperative inflammation. Nepafenac was more effective than fluorometholone in preventing CME and BAB disruption and in providing early recovery of vision.

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm. 
Symptomatic choroidal metastases is a rare presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Choroidal metastases (CM) are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. CM is detected in 2% to 7% of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is generally discovered at the end-stage of the disease. Singh et al. (2) reported the demographic profile, histology, disease stage, ocular and lung lesions, diagnostic and treatment (systemic and ocular) modalities, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer : 67% of patients were male and 78% were current or ex-smokers, mean age was 55 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type followed by squamous and small cell. Bilateral involvement was rare (<10%). Ocular treatment modalities included radiation, enucleation, and systemic steroids. Regression of choroidal metastases with treatment was observed in 67% of patients who did not undergo enucleation.

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm.

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT, Indocyanine Green Angiography.
Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots), retinal edema, narrowed arterioles, arterio-venous crossing, no retinal hemorrhages.
Indocyanine Green Angiography, after 2 min: multifocal areas with choriocapillaris non-perfusion.

OCT: focal thickening of retinal nerve fiber layer, intraretinal irregularities, no serous retinal detachment.
Discussion: Ocular manifestations of systemic hypertension are common and result in vascular compromise at the level of the retina, the choroid, or the optic nerve. Hypertensive choroidopathy is caused by fibrinoid necrosis of the choroidal arterioles. Hypertensive choroidopathy is characterized by hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris, break down of the retinal pigment epithelial cells, and hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots). Hypertensive choroidopathy is a complication of systemic hypertension and can be the harbinger of a life-threatening hypertensive emergency.

Colour Photography Posterior Segment: hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots), retinal edema, narrowed arterioles, arterio-venous crossing, no retinal hemorrhages.
Indocyanine Green Angiography, after 2 min: multifocal areas with choriocapillaris non-perfusion.
Mosaic Image: Colour Photography Posterior Segment & Indocyanine Green Angiography: hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots areas) corresponding with areas of choriocapillaris non-perfusion.
OCT: focal thickening of retinal nerve fiber layer, intraretinal irregularities, no serous retinal detachment.
Discussion: Ocular manifestations of systemic hypertension are common and result in vascular compromise at the level of the retina, the choroid, or the optic nerve. Hypertensive choroidopathy is caused by fibrinoid necrosis of the choroidal arterioles. Hypertensive choroidopathy is characterized by hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris, break down of the retinal pigment epithelial cells, and hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots). Hypertensive choroidopathy is a complication of systemic hypertension and can be the harbinger of a life-threatening hypertensive emergency.

Ocular Medical History: blurred vision at OS, salmon-colored subconjunctival lesion of the left eye consistent with an epibulbar lymphoma. After incisional biopsy and surgical tumor reduction a fractionnated stereotactical radiotherapy of left orbita inclusive left eye was performed with a total dose of 40 Gy (single dose of 2,0 Gy).
General Medical History: no relevant events, systemic lymphoma was absent. 
Major complaint: blurred vision at OS.
Purpose: to report the clinical, ultrasonographic, and histological features of choroidal lymphoma .

Methods: Colour Photography Anterior Segment, Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT, Ultrasound, Histology.

Findings:
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: transscleral epibulbar (extraocular) extension, visible as a pink mass under the conjunctiva and tenon fascia.
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: multifocal creamy-yellow infiltrates at the level of choroid.
Optical coherence tomography: irregular choroidal contour over the area of choroidal infiltration, subretinal fluid involving more than 1 quadrant.

Discussion:
Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is a highly contagious infection caused by adenovirus types 8, 19, and 37. The formation of subepithelial nummular infiltrates may lead to permanent visual disturbance. These infiltrates consist histopathologically of an accumulation of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and fibroblasts. The reasons for the persistence of these nummular infiltrates are not fully understood. It was reported (1) that nummuli can be identified as areas with an accumulation of dendritic cells (Langerhans cells) as well as punctiform structures located in the basal cell layer and in the region of the subepithelial nerve plexus.
Steroid therapy for persistent or recurrent nummular adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis has little benefit because of the frequent recurrences, and mostly ""offers"" only serious steroid side effects. Reinhard et al. (2) reported that topical CSA 2% 1-4 times daily is about as effective as topical steroids in the symptomatic treatment of non-scarred nummuli after epidemic keratoconjunctivitis without the serious steroid side effects. Topical CSA treatment of nummuli after epidemic keratoconjunctivitis seems to be a recommendable alternative for the potentially dangerous steroid therapy.

Patient:  72 years of age, male; BCVA OS 0.1, nuclear cataract.
Ocular medical history: deterioration of vision over two years, regular cataract surgery with small incision at February 4th 2013, no increase of BCVA in  February 27th 2013 due to cystoid macular edema.  Begin of therapy with oral carboanhydrase inhibitors (250mg/d), and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for three weeks.    
General medical history: rheumatoid arthritis, arterial hypertension.
Main complaint: lack of improvement of vision after cataract surgery. 
Purpose: to show improvement of cystoid macular edema within four weeks under oral carboanhydrase inhibitors and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.     
Method: Patient undergone spectralis-OCT before and after begin of therapy
Findings: 
OCT from February 27th 2013: cystoid macular edema with epiretinal membrane. 
OCT from March 25th 2013: no cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane.
Discussion: Suggested factors in CME after cataract surgery include hypotony, vitreous traction, and inflammation. There is the hypothesis, disruption of the BAB is a dominating factor in CME. It was suggested (1) that inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, which are biosynthesized by the anterior uvea and lens epithelial cells, are triggered by surgical trauma, leading to disruption of the BAB. As a result, various inflammatory mediators accumulate in the aqueous humor. The mediators are dispersed throughout the vitreous and increase the permeability of retinal vessels. The blood–retinal barrier (BRB) becomes disrupted, inducing CME over time. Predispositions to BAB and BRB disruption include aging, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and other diseases.
Data (2) suggest that the inflammatory mediators increase in the aqueous for 1 to 2 weeks after cataract and IOL surgery. 
It was shown (3), that topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) prevents the spike-like increase of flare, implying that NSAIDs are more effective than steroidal agents in preventing postoperative inflammation. Nepafenac was more effective than fluorometholone in preventing CME and BAB disruption and in providing early recovery of vision.

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss .

Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Purpose: evaluating ganglion cell complex (GCC) and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness to present regional coincidence of focal retinal nerve layer fiber loss and retinal ganglion cell loss. 

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, Red Free Photography Posterior Pole, SD-OCT, Visual Field. 

Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: focal retinal nerve fiber layer loss with optic disc hemorrhage at 7h.

Discussion: 
Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy characterized by retinal ganglion cells (RGC) loss and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) injury. Medeiros FA et al. (1) showed, that glaucomatous eyes had an average retinal ganglion cells loss of 28%, ranging from 6% to 57%, at the time of the earliest visual field defect on standard automated perimetry (SAP) visual fields.

Patient: 52 years of age, female, BCVA 1.0, IOP 21 mmHg.
Ocular Medical History: cataract surgery in 2012.
General Medical History: empty.
Purpose: to present a focal island of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule with a reproducible glaucoma-like visual field defect.
Methods: Colour Photography Anterior Segment, Visual Field, OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: localized island of lens epithelial cells on inferior posterior capsule.  
Visual Field: superior scotoma mimicking a reproducible glaucomatous visual field defect.
OCT:  Regular retinal nerve fiber thickness.
Discussion:  
Island of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule were common postoperatively. A focal collection of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule can mimic a glaucomatous visual field defect. García-Medina JJ  et al. (1) concluded that focal posterior capsular opacification may alter visual field results, and may even simulate the perimetric behaviour of other pathologies such as glaucoma. Consequently, the presence of  a focal posterior capsular opacification should be considered in the interpretation of any automated perimetry in pseudophakic patients.

Ocular Medical History: ocular hypertension, trabeculotomy at OD & OS 10 years ago. 
General medical History: empty
Main Complaint: decreased vision at OD. 
Methods: Colour image, OCT.
Findings:
Anterior segment colour image of OS: Schwalbe‘s ring is seen as a central thickening and displacement of Schwalbe‘s line (arrows), visible with the slitlamp as an irregular white line just concentric to the limbus. At 3h the prominent Schwalbe‘s ring shows an attached iris strand (*) 
Optic nerve head colour image of OD&OS: no cupping, pale rim. 
OCT of OS: regular retinal nerve fiber thickness.
Ww-Perimetry:  Focal scotoma at OD with mean defect of 3.1 dB, no scotoma at OS.
Discussion:
Mesodermal abnormalities of the anterior segment include Axenfeld‘s anomaly and Rieger‘s anomaly. Axenfeld's anomaly shows a posterior embryotoxon. Posterior embryotoxon is a prominent Schwalbe's line that may be a partial or complete bilateral ring and is usually visible on gross external examination. It is an indication of either Axenfeld's anomaly/syndrome or Rieger's anomaly/syndrome, both of which are anterior chamber syndromes that put patients at risk for glaucoma.

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

Discussion: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, resulting in structural damage to the optic nerve head (ONH) and inner retina.  Approximately half of these retinal ganglion cells are located within 4.5 mm of the center of the fovea. The superficial capillaries mainly nourish the ganglion cell layer. Penteado RC (1) evaluated  in 185 eyes the association between macula vascular density assessed by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and central visual field (VF) threshold sensitivities in healthy, glaucoma suspect, and glaucoma patients.  He found  that  severe glaucoma subjects had significantly lower macula vessel density values compared with early glaucoma or healthy eyes.  They reported  that glaucoma eyes generally had sparser macula capillary networks compared with healthy eyes, glaucoma suspects, or mild glaucoma eyes. They documented an average macula vessel density  for healthy eyes  of 52.5%±3.7%, and for moderate/severe glaucoma patients  of 45.2%±3.9%. Macula OCT-A  may be an important adjunctive tool for identifying subjects at risk for developing glaucoma.​

Discussion: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, resulting in structural damage to the optic nerve head (ONH) and inner retina.  Approximately half of these retinal ganglion cells are located within 4.5 mm of the center of the fovea. The superficial capillaries mainly nourish the ganglion cell layer. Penteado RC (1) evaluated  in 185 eyes the association between macula vascular density assessed by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and central visual field (VF) threshold sensitivities in healthy, glaucoma suspect, and glaucoma patients.  He found  that  severe glaucoma subjects had significantly lower macula vessel density values compared with early glaucoma or healthy eyes.  They reported  that glaucoma eyes generally had sparser macula capillary networks compared with healthy eyes, glaucoma suspects, or mild glaucoma eyes. They documented an average macula vessel density  for healthy eyes  of 52.5%±3.7%, and for moderate/severe glaucoma patients  of 45.2%±3.9%. Macula OCT-A  may be an important adjunctive tool for identifying subjects at risk for developing glaucoma.​

General Medical History: Hashimoto thyreoditis.
Ocular Medical History: in 2005 parapapillary bleedings with regular visual fields, the 24h-IOP profiles were always 14-16 mmHg at OD and OS without any therapy, there was a regular cerebral MRI . 
Main complaint: parapapillary bleedings.
Purpose: to show transition from pre-perimetric to perimetric glaucoma  with a clear glaucomatous change in the optic nerve head over an interval of 7 years  from 2006 to 2013.
Methods: Fundus Colour Image, w-w-Perimetry  30° Octopus G1, SD-OCT Heidelberg Engineering.
Findings:
Colour fundus imaging: showing a structural progression of the optic nerve head over 7 years  from 2006 to 2013, depicting in 2013 a parapapillary hemorrhage at 11h with minor changes in the retinal pigment epithelium.
Visual field : showing minor changes in the visual fields from 2006 to 2007, and in 2008 a clear scotoma. Over 7 years there was a mean loss of 1,2 dB/year and a functional defect of -8.7% per year with an acceleration in the last 3 years.
SD-OCT: showing in 2008 a localized  defect at 7h, in 2013 a general atrophy and a deep defect at 7h of the retinal fiber layer. The retinal nerve fiber layer showed a decrease from 79 µm to 65 µma over 6 years.

Dicussion: 
In POAG the loss of neuroretinal rim area per year could be very small. Mardin  (1) described, that a  glaucoma induced rim loss is very small per year and should be differentiated from regular age-related loss. The most pronounced loss in glaucoma  is temporal, both superior and inferior. Bengtsson et al (2) examined distributions of rates of progression from visual field series in pseudophakic eyes by Octopus perimeter (Haag Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland). They found in glaucoma patients a mean loss of 2.7%/year with the mean defect index MDI.

In POAG the loss of neuroretinal rim area per year could be very small. Mardin  (1) described, that a  glaucoma induced rim loss is very small per year and should be differentiated from regular age-related loss. The most pronounced loss in glaucoma  is temporal, both superior and inferior. Bengtsson et al (2) examined distributions of rates of progression from visual field series in pseudophakic eyes by Octopus perimeter (Haag Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland). They found in glaucoma patients a mean loss of 2.7%/year with the mean defect index MDI.

Patient: 57 years of age, female,  autorefraction OD -2.5-0.25/180°, OS -2.75-0.25/5°, BCVA 1.0 at OD, 1.0 at OS, IOP RA 14 mmHg, IOP LA 14 mmHg, pachymetry OD 547 µm, OS 546 µm.
General Medical History: Hashimoto thyreoditis.
Ocular Medical History: in 2005 parapapillary bleedings with regular visual fields, the 24h-IOP profiles were always 14-16 mmHg at OD and OS without any therapy, there was a regular cerebral MRI . 
Main complaint: parapapillary bleedings.
Purpose: to show transition from pre-perimetric to perimetric glaucoma  with a clear glaucomatous change in the optic nerve head over an interval of 7 years  from 2006 to 2013.
Methods: Fundus Colour Image, w-w-Perimetry  30° Octopus G1, SD-OCT Heidelberg Engineering.
Findings:
Colour fundus imaging: showing a structural progression of the optic nerve head over 7 years  from 2006 to 2013, depicting in 2013 a parapapillary hemorrhage at 11h with minor changes in the retinal pigment epithelium.
Visual field : showing minor changes in the visual fields from 2006 to 2007, and in 2008 a clear scotoma. Over 7 years there was a mean loss of 1,2 dB/year and a functional defect of -8.7% per year with an acceleration in the last 3 years.
SD-OCT: showing in 2008 a localized  defect at 7h, in 2013 a general atrophy and a deep defect at 7h of the retinal fiber layer. The retinal nerve fiber layer showed a decrease from 79 µm to 65 µma over 6 years.

Dicussion: 
In POAG the loss of neuroretinal rim area per year could be very small. Mardin  (1) described, that a  glaucoma induced rim loss is very small per year and should be differentiated from regular age-related loss. The most pronounced loss in glaucoma  is temporal, both superior and inferior. Bengtsson et al (2) examined distributions of rates of progression from visual field series in pseudophakic eyes by Octopus perimeter (Haag Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland). They found in glaucoma patients a mean loss of 2.7%/year with the mean defect index MDI.

Purpose:  to present homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects, due to defect im Meyer‘s loop after antiepileptical neurosurgery. 
Method: patient undergone examination of visual field( w-w-perimetry, FDT), retinal nerve fiber thickness (Spectralis-OCT HE), fundus photography (Kowa-Non-myd camera), and MRI (3-Tesla, Siemens)
Findings:

MRI: FLAIR sequences on the level of the midbrain / LGN demonstrating the gliotic defect (arrow) after partial temporal lobe resection (Taylor-resection), (*) extending into the very ventral part of the optic radiation (Meyer´s loop) 
Discussion
Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula (1). Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is increasingly performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was reported (2) that most of the patients who had undergone SelAH had homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects contralateral to the side of the surgery.

Ocular medical history: Exotropy of OD, BCVA with CL 0.8 at OD;. Vision improved from 0.6 to 0.8 with wear of contact lenses.
General Medical History: empty
Main complaint: decrease of vision at OD, glasses showed no improvement of vision at OD.
Purpose: to show unilateral keratoconus suspect without any slit-lamp findings causing decreased vision.
Methods: Colour Photography, Tomey Topography.
Findings:
Colour Slit Lamp Photography: no visible corneal stromal thinning, no conical protrusion of the cornea at the apex, no Fleischer ring, no Vogt striae, and no anterior corneal stromal scar.
Corneal topography: showing an area of inferior steepening combined with an oblique cylinder >4 diopters and steep keratometric curvature greater than 47 D.
Discussion:
Corneal topography pattern recognition combined with quantitative diagnostic indices is useful for the screening of keratoconus (KC). KC is a noninflammatory progressive corneal disease characterized by localized conical protrusion, apical thinning, irregular astigmatism, and central scarring in the cornea. Keratoconus and other forms of corneal ectasias may be considered as a spectrum of primary corneal ectasia. The prevalence of KC is approximately one per 2,000 in the general population. Lim et al. (1) characterized keratoconus suspect (1) by corneal topography showing an area of central, inferior, or superior steepening combined with any of the following: oblique cylinder >1.5 diopters (D); steep keratometric curvature greater than 47 D, or central corneal thickness less than 500 μm, but without any slit-lamp findings.

Patient: 13 years of age, male, BCVA 0.4 at OD, 0.9 at OS.
General Medical History: new onset, single episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure , MRI showed unclear cerebral tumor.
Ocular Medical History: up to the time of presentation no subjective problems with vision.

Purpose: to show bitemporal and diffuse optic nerve atrophy in suspected central neurocytoma after a new onset, single episode of generalized seizure.
       
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, SD-OCT, Visual Field, cMRI.
Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: regular optic nerve head in OD and OS.
SD-OCT: diffuse and temporally decreased retinal nerve fiber thickness in OD>OS
Visual Field: hemianopsia at OD, complete visual field defect at OS. 
Cranial MRI: Coronal T1-weighted and (B) sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showing  cystic frontobasal and suprasellar lesion with intra- and extraventricular parts with increased T2-signal, no contrast media uptake and no diffusion restriction. Only slight perifocal edema. The maximal extent is 68 x 43 x 58 mm. In summary, this lesion is most likely a central neurocytoma.
Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

Patient: 34 years of age, female, BCVA  1.0 at OD , 1.0 at OS, IOP 17/15 mmHg.
General Medical History: empty. 
Ocular Medical History: unclear visual field defect at OD. 
Main Complaint: vision decline at OD.
Purpose: to present pseudo-glaucomatous visual field defect in pit of optic nerve head.
Methods: colour photography posterior pole, OCT Triton, visual field. 
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: myopic configuration, herniation of retinal tissue  with focal rim excavation at 7h.
Visual field: visual field defect temporal superior.
OCT Triton, macula: regular macula,  deep rim excavation at  8h.  
OCT Triton, retinal nerve layer: focal thinning  from  6-9h
Discussion: In general pits of the optic nerve head (OPD) are oval cavities or depressions in the optic disc. Itis a herniation of dysplastic retinal tissue into a collagen rich excavation extending into the subarachnoid space through a defect in the lamina cribrosa.  Pits of the optic nerve can appear as a localized pit-like invagination in the optic disc. They can be congenital or acquired. ODPs can remain clinically asymptomatic in many cases. In about 50% patients with ODPs develop optic disc pit related maculopathy with retinoschisis, atrophy of inner retinal layers, serous macular detachment and significant loss of vision. 1-2

General medical history:  HIV since 10 years,  systemic therapy  with truvada and isentress. 
Ocular medical history:  visual acuity not constant, varied within months from 0.4 to 0.8.
Main Complaints: varying visual  acuity. 
Methods:
 Colour Photography, VEP, OCT.
Findings:  
 Colour Photography: pale optic nerve head.
OCT: diminuished retinal nerve fiber  thickness.
VEP: prolonged latencies, regular amplitude.

Discussion:
Optic neuropathies in HIV patients are caused by a variety of pathologies including infectious, compressive and inflammatory processes. There is evidence that the optic nerves of HIV infected patients can undergo chronic degeneration resulting in axonal loss. The current widely accepted theory emphasises the key role of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the genesis of primary HIV optic neuropathy. The pathogenesis of neuronal damage has been ascribed to the combined effect of neurotoxic agents including viral proteins and neurotoxic factors released from activated microglia and macrophages. 
Mwanza et al. (1) found, that VEPs were abnormal in 57% and 42% of HIV infected patients with and without neurological symptoms. HIV positive patients with neurological symptoms are not at higher risk for optic nerve damage than those without neurological manifestations. This support the hypothesis according to which axonal loss of the optic nerve is a common process occurring in all HIV infected subjects. 
There is evidence suggesting that, despite normal visual acuity, HIV infected subjects may have subclinical dysfunction of the optic nerves/retrochiasmal visual pathways that can be detected using electrophysiological methods.
A loss of cortical neurons has been found in asymptomatic HIV positive subjects in early stages of the infection. These lesions as well as others affecting the retrogeniculate part of the visual pathways, especially the primary visual cortex, may result in delay in both cortical processing and signal generation and thus in VEP abnormalities.

MRI: in 11/2013 complete infarction of posterior cerebral artery (T1) (star).
MRI-DTI: in 01/2014 decreased axonal integrity in posterior part of optic radiation (arrow). 
Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

Patient: 63 years of age, female, BCVA 0.8 at OD, 0.9 at OS; 
General Medical History: two months before, in Nov 2013 acute infarction of posterior cerebral artery, long standing arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: regular pseudophakia.
Main Complaint: altered visual field to the left side.
Purpose: to demonstrate complete visual field defect to the left side after posterior cerebral artery infarction.
Methods: Colour Photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), ww-Perimetry (Octopus G1), MRT (Siemens, TimTrio). 
Colour Photography OD& OS: pale optic nerve head (OD>OS), no cupping.
OCT OD& OS : minimal diffuse thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer.
ww-Perimetry OD& OS : complete homonymus visual defect to the left side.
MRI: in 11/2013 complete infarction of posterior cerebral artery (T1) (star).
MRI-DTI: in 01/2014 decreased axonal integrity in posterior part of optic radiation (arrow). 
Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

On confrontational visual fields, a defect was detected and prompted a formal visual field.  The left homonymous hemianopia was revealed at that time. 

A hemianopia can be congruous or complete. In this case, the image reveals a complete left hemianopia. A temporal crescent is absent, this tells us the lesion is likely to be occipital. Macular sparing is absent, this tells us the lesion is likely to be occipital. This lesion points to a parietal lesion, which can be confirmed with OKN asymmetry (pursuit problems to the side of the lesion). 

Complete hemianopias localizes the lesion retrochiasmal, but they cannot tell us where the lesion is present. The lesion can be present in the optic tract, optic radiations of parietal lobe or occipital cortex. Cogan's Dictum can help us localize the lesion.

Cogan's Dictum states:
1. Homonymous hemianopia plus asymmetric OKN=likely mass lesion, parietal lobe
2. Homonymous hemianopia plus symmetric OKN= likely vascular infarction, occipital lobe

General medical history: empty
Main complaint: homonymous peripherial visual defect 
Purpose:  to present homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects, due to defect im Meyer‘s loop after antiepileptical neurosurgery. 
Method: patient undergone examination of visual field( w-w-perimetry, FDT), retinal nerve fiber thickness (Spectralis-OCT HE), fundus photography (Kowa-Non-myd camera), and MRI (3-Tesla, Siemens)
Findings: 
Visual field (w-w-perimetry): homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects

MRI: FLAIR sequences on the level of the midbrain / LGN demonstrating the gliotic defect (arrow) after partial temporal lobe resection (Taylor-resection), (*) extending into the very ventral part of the optic radiation (Meyer´s loop) 
Discussion
Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula (1). Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is increasingly performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was reported (2) that most of the patients who had undergone SelAH had homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects contralateral to the side of the surgery.

General Medical History:  Histology confirmed Morbus Recklinghausen, spastic hemiplegia after partial tumor resection of pilocytic atrocytoma, shunt installation and postoperative radiation therapy. 
Ocular Medical History: homonymous visual field defect to the right side.  
Purpose: to present reduced homonymous retinal ganglien cell layer of OD and OS corresponding to homonymous visual field defect after partial tumor resection of pilocytic atrocytoma  in cerebral neurofibromatosis.

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), visual field, MRI. 

Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Segment:  optic nerve atrophy in OD and OS.
SD-OCT : decreased thickness of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in nasal and temporal area, OD>OS.
SD-OCT :  homonymous thinning of of retinal ganglion cell layer in OD and OS nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior to the fovea corresponding to homonymous visual field field defect.
Visual Field: homonymous field defect in OD and OS.
MRI: after partial tumor resection extensive defect area with surrounding gliosis in the left temporal and occipital lobes involving the left optic radiation.   

Discussion:
It is recognized that significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss occurs in MS patients following optic neuritis. A reduction in RGC may be identified earlier due to transient edema in the acute stage of ON masking any early RNFL loss. Several recent studies (1, 2) have suggested that RGC layer thinning is a good measure of disease-related visual and general disability and brain atrophy. Ocular manifestations of Von Recklinghausen disease are frequent and can reveal the disease. Benchekroun O et al. (3) examined 11 patients with Neurofibromatosis during two years. He suggested that an ophthalmologic examination must always be performed if Von Recklinghausen is suspected.

Discussion:
Spontaneous hyphema refers to a nontraumatic hemorrhage in the anterior chamber and may result from such conditions as rubeosis iridis, intraocular neoplasms, blood dyscrasias, severe iritis, fibrovascular membranes in the retrolental or zonular area, and vascular anomalies of the iris. Terry et al. (1) presented  a case with a spontaneous hyphema occurring as a result of iris neovascularization in a patient who suffered from occlusion of the central retinal vein.

Discussion:
Idiopathic macular telangiectasia type 2 (Mac Tel 2) is an acquired bilateral neurodegenerative macular disease. Based on current imaging modalities, Mac Tel 2 appears to be a primary neuroretinal degenerative condition with a secondary vascular involvement. Gass and Oyakawa (1) classified idiopathic juxtafoveolar retinal telangiectasis into four groups. Group 1 is characterized by unilateral parafoveal retinal telangiectasis associated with lipid and serous retinal exudation. Group 2 patients were mostly men with bilateral symmetric juxtafoveolar telangiectasis affecting the temporal half of the juxtafoveolar areas with minimal intraretinal exudation. Group 3 included eyes in both males and females that had bilateral parafoveolar telangiectasis with minimal intraretinal exudation, bilateral easily visible telangiectasis, and capillary occlusion. Group 4 referred to cases with familial optic disc pallor and perifoveolar retinal capillary occlusion. Wu et al. published an overview (2). He stated, that pathogenesis remains unclear. Müller cells and macular pigment appear to play a central role. The disease usually manifests itself during the fourth to sixth decades of life. Long-term prognosis for central vision is variable and depends on the development of SRNV or macular atrophy. Currently there is no known treatment for the underlying cause of this condition, but treatment of the SRNV may be beneficial.

Discussion
Fuchs' corneal dystrophy - a dominantly inherited disorder -  is a slowly progressive, bilateral corneal dystrophy that affects corneal endothelial cells. 
Cataract surgery is a risk factor for corneal endothelial cell loss. Corneal endothelial cell loss, a major complication that sometimes occurs after cataract surgery, can lead to corneal edema and decompensation if cell density falls to 500 cells/mm2 or below. Yamazoe et al (1) reported that the mean rate of endothelial cell loss is about 12% ± 23%.  Seitzman  et al (2) reported a series of patients with Fuchs' dystrophy (136 eyes) undergoing cataract surgery. The average preoperative corneal thickness ranged from 482 to 674 µm. 37% had preoperative corneal thickness of 600 µm or thicker. Of eyes with preoperative pachymetry measurements of 600 µm or thicker, 10% progressed to penetrating keratoplasty. Patients with a preoperative corneal thickness of >640 μm had a 22.2% rate of requiring a corneal transplant. Their data suggest that current cataract removal techniques allow for excellent visual rehabilitation in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy who have a preoperative corneal thickness lower than 600 µm. They recommend a concurrent penetrating keratoplasty with cataract surgery in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy and a corneal thickness of >640 μm.

General medical history:  hypothyreosis in the past, now regular TSH and TRH, ANCA negative. 
Ocular Medical History: impairment of vision at both eyes, conjunctival chemosis, desaturation of color vision. After therapy with steroids  (400 mg) over 5 days significant improvement of visual fields, VEP amplitude and latency. 
Main complaint: diplopia and conjunctival chemosis.
Purpose: to present findings of an orbital apex syndrome in Graves disease. 
Methods: 
Facial Colour Photography, Visual Evoked Potential, Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging , visual field 90°, OCT optic nerve head.
Findings:
Facial  Colour Image:  strabism, conjunctival chemosis.
VEP: impaired amplitude and latency at OD.
Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging :  at both eyes apical orbital crowding  with enlargement of of extraocular muscles, spindle like spreading of the rectus muscles without involvement of the tendon,  compression of the optic nerve in the orbital apex (crowded orbital apex syndrome), and absence of any space occupying intraorbital process. 
Visual field 90°: peripherial scotoma at OD, regular field at OS
OCT optic nerve head: showing no edema of optic nerve head of OD.
Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

Patient: 50 years of age, male, BCVA 1.0 at OD, 1/20 at OS, IOP 13 mmHg at OD, 15 mmHg at OS.
Ocular Medical History: in October 2012 first visit, suffered from decreased vision since 2 weeks with an edema of the optic nerve head at OS.
General Medical History:  in October 2012, 14.000 leucocytes, MRI revealing  maxillary sinusitis at left side, followed by maxillary surgery next day .
Main Complaint: loss of vision at OS.
Purpose: to present optic nerve head edema followed by atrophy as a consequence of maxillary sinusitis.
Methods: colour fundus photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), MRI (SiemensTrio), w-w-perimetry (Octpus G1).
Findings:
Colour photography, in October 2012: presenting an unilateral optic nerve head edema  with a parapapillary bleeding at 7h at OS 
SD-OCT, in October 2012: showing an edema of the optic nerve head at OS.
MRI, in October 2012: depicting a complete complete filling of left maxillary and frontal sinus.
W-w-perimetry, in November 2012: presenting a deep and large scotoma at OS.
SD-OCT, in March 2013: showing a decreased retinal nerve fiber layer at OS, and no edema of optic nerve head.
Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

Ocular Medical History: in 01/2012 fast reduction of VA at OS after systemic therapy over three weeks with meropenem (Meronem®, vancomycin und linezolid (Zyvoxid®).
Main Complaint: reduction of VA in OS.
Findings:
1) Colour Photography: bilateral optic nerve atrophy (OS>OD).
2) VEP: decreased amplitudes und prolonged latencies.
3) OCT: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.
Discussion:
It was reported (1,2), that antibiotic therapy with Linezolid (Zyvoxid®) can cause optic nerve atrophy. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, used against infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may lead to progressive, potentially irreversible neuropathies of the optic nerve especially in long-time application.
Linezolid is part of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal initiation complex. Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

Patient: 55 years of age, male, BCVA  0.1 at OD , 1.0 at OS, IOP 10/10 mmHg under topical medication.
___General Medical History: aortic valve insufficiency, arterial hypertension. 
___Ocular Medical History: acute increase of intraocular pressure with values of 40 mmHg with glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy, followed by an incomplete central  retinal vein occlusion with cystoid macular edema,  and an intravitreal  antiVEGF-injection. 
___Main Complaint: decline of visual acuity at OD.
___Purpose: to present asymmetric macular capillary rarefication shown by OCT-angiography.
___Methods: colour photography posterior pole, Triton OCT-angiography, Triton OCT, visual field. 
___Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole, OD: pale optic nerve atrophy, focal retinal hemorrhages.
Visual field, OD: concentric visual field defect.
Triton OCT, OD:  thinning of retinal nerve layer.

___Discussion:  In presented case the increased foveolar avascular zone and the rarefication of macular capillaries  in OD may be caused by the venous vascular dysregulation, and glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy. Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy with optic nerve deterioration, visual field defects, and vascular dysregulation and rarefication. Müller et al. and Zivkovicet al. investigated macular capillaries in glaucoma by OCT-angiography. Zivkovic M et al. (2) measured foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in NTG and healthy subjects. He reported that mean horizontal, mean vertical diameter, and FAZ area were significantly enlarged in the NTG group. Müller et al. (1)  investigated central macular microvasculature in glaucoma patients. He found in perimetric glaucoma patients significantly reduced density maps of superficial foveal flow.

Discussion:
Jonas et al (1) described morphological optic nerve head variables to classify glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Thus, glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy is classified by morphologic changes in the intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer: size and shape of the optic disc; size, shape and pallor of the neuroretinal rim; size of the optic cup in relation to the area of the disc; configuration and depth of the optic cup; cup-to-disc diameter ratio and cup-to-disc area ratio; presence and location of splinter-shaped haemorrhages; occurrence, size, configuration and location of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy; diffuse and/or focal decrease of the diameter of the retinal arterioles; and visibility of the retinal nerve fibre layer. Assessment of these variables is useful for the detection of glaucomatous optic nerve damage, and to differentiate various types of optic nerve atrophy. He suggested, that highest diagnostic power had the vertical cup-to-disc diameter ratio corrected for its dependence on the optic disc size, total neuroretinal rim area, rim-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size, and cup-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size. Oliveira C et al (2) using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope found a mean optic disc size in white subjects of 1.97+-0.6 mm².

Discussion:
Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked retinal dystrophy belonging to the family of blinding disorders. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. CHM is caused by mutations in the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1) gene, which encodes a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (1). Complete deletion of the CHM gene causes severe choroideremia. Mura et al. (2) presented results of serial ERGs documenting progression first of rod and then of cone disease.

OCT: focal thickening of retinal nerve fiber layer, intraretinal irregularities, no serous retinal detachment.
Discussion: Ocular manifestations of systemic hypertension are common and result in vascular compromise at the level of the retina, the choroid, or the optic nerve. Hypertensive choroidopathy is caused by fibrinoid necrosis of the choroidal arterioles. Hypertensive choroidopathy is characterized by hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris, break down of the retinal pigment epithelial cells, and hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots). Hypertensive choroidopathy is a complication of systemic hypertension and can be the harbinger of a life-threatening hypertensive emergency.

General Medical History: -.
Ocular Medical History: control of longlasting unilateral corectopia.
Purpose: to show bilateral choroidal coloboma with unilateral iridal coloboma.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, Colour Photography Anterior Segment, SD-OCT.
Findings: 
SD-OCT: bilateral  choroidal coloboma. 
Colour Photography Posterior Segment of OD: coloboma located in the equatorial region with attached retina along the margin of the coloboma.
Colour Photography Anterior Segment of OS: inferior corectopia upon light-induced miosis. 
Colour Photography Anterior Segment of OS: dilated pupil showing cataract, sectorial iridal coloboma and sectorial zonulalysis.
SD-OCT of OD: margin of choroidal coloboma appearance of a hump owing to inward turning of the retinochoroidal layers, no thickening of the layers at the margin.
Discussion: Ocular coloboma is a common malformation. It includes a spectrum of anomalies that ranges from iris coloboma to clinical anophthalmos. Coloboma is etiologically heterogeneous. The spectrum  can vary from small colobomas located in the equatorial region that do not interfere with vision, to large colobomas involving the disc and macula with severe impairment of vision. Choroidal coloboma is a congenital defect caused by defective closure of embryonal fissure, which normally takes place during the 6th week of gestation. As an isolated defect, it is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs (1, 3). Gopal L et al. (2) described choroidal colobomas. Genetic as well as environmental causes have been proposed to cause an intrauterine insult that can lead to defective closure of the embryonal fissure leading to coloboma of the fundus (3). Histologically, the colobomatous area is deficient in normal choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and the retina.

Discussion:
It was shown by Liu et al. (1) that progression and regression of DR were strongly associated with blood pressure and glycemic exposure.  In a huge study they investigated the progression and regression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the effects of population risk factors on the rates of transition across retinopathy stages. From 1990 to 2011   4,758 diabetic patients who were diagnosed at 35 years of age or older were observed. They found a consistent risk effect of HbA1c on the progression  from no retinopathy to mild background DR a hazard ratio per SD of HbA1c  of 1.42, from mild BDR to observable BDR a hazard ratio of 1.32, and from observable BDR to severe nonproliferative/proliferative DR a hazard ratio of 2.23. Similarly, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure increased the risk for the transition from the asymptomatic phase to mild BDR  with a hazard ratio of 1.20 and from the mild BDR to observable BDR with a hazard ratio of 1.87, respectively. Regression from mild BDR to no DR was associated with lower SBP and lower HbA1c .

Patient: 45 years of age, male, BCVA 0.6. 
General Medical History: empty.
Ocular Medical History: in 2003 Laser-assisted in Situ Keratomileusis, in 2014 ocular blunt trauma with flap dislocation, and epithelial cell growth into the interface, in 2014 two flap-lift retreatments with surgical flap reposition,  good visual recovery.
Purpose: to visualize corneal structural changes and epithelial ingrowth in a young male patient after a blunt trauma with LASIK flap dislocation  after LASIK 11 years ago. 
Methods:  Colour Photography Anterior Segment, Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SL-OCT), Topography (Tomey)) 
Findings:
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: Focal area of epithelial ingrowth.
SL-OCT: epithelial ingrowth underneath the flap, no flap stromal edema.
Topography: irregular astigmatism.
Discussion:
Interface complications include infectious keratitis, diffuse lamellar keratitis, central toxic keratopathy, pressure-induced stromal keratopathy (PISK), and epithelial ingrowth. Güell J et al. (1) reported a low incidence of epithelial ingrowth after regular LASIK. From a total of 7520 LASIK refractive eyes, 13 eyes with epithelial ingrowth were treated. Randleman JB  et al. (2) described epithelial ingrowth as a LASIK interface complication. Epithelial ingrowth is easily distinguishable from other interface complications and may be self-limited or require flap lift to treat irregular astigmatism and prevent flap melt.

Discussion
Differentiating ischemic CRVO from nonischemic CRVO is crucial. Fluorescein fundus angiography during the early acute phase of CRVO provided reliable information about retinal capillary nonperfusion in approximately 60% of cases.  Visual outcome is good in nonischemic CRVO and poor in ischemic CRVO. Hayreh (1) suggested, that a clear differentiation of CRVO into nonischemic and ischemic types, based primarily on functional criteria, is fundamental in determining visual outcome. He reported that visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 78% with nonischemic CRVO and in only 1% with ischemic CRVO. Final visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 83% with nonischemic CRVO and in only 12% with ischemic CRVO. Of 100% eyes with nonischemic CRVO, about 10% converted to the ischemic type. Hayreh reported, that there was a higher prevalence of history of cerebrovascular disease in those that converted from nonischemic to ischemic CRVO. Most CRVO eyes start as nonischemic and some convert later to ischemic CRVO.

It was suggested, that hemodynamic changes downstream of the A/V crossing may be essential in the pathogenesis of BRVO. Muraoka et al. (1) performed sequential thin sectioning with OCT. This allowed detailed anatomic correlation between the artery and the vein, revealing that BRVO occurred at the arterial overcrossing in about 70% of the eyes investigated. At the venous overcrossing, the mechanical compression caused by the Inner Limiting Membrane ILM and the arterial walls at the crossing would be primarily related to the onset of BRVO. The affected veins were compressed and choked between the ILM and the arterial wall at the venous overcrossing.

Ocular Medical History: decreased vision in OD.
Main Complaint: unclear vision loss.
Purpose: to present peripherial ischemic retinopathy in mainly regular central fundus.
Methods: Colour Photogaphy Posterior Segment, Optical Coherence Tomography, Fundus Fluorescein Angiography.  
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: nonperfused segment in superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, few intraretinal hemorrhages, no nerve fiber layer infarcts, no optic disc edema.
Fluorescein angiography (FA): nonperfused segment of superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, peripherial retinal neovascularisation, peripheral capillary nonperfusion with more than 10 disc diameters of retinal capillary nonperfusion.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT): decrease in foveal thickness, impaired inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, no macular swelling, no macular edema.
Discussion: 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause after diabetic retinopathy of vision loss due to retinal vascular disease. Branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is about 3-6 times more common than central vein occlusion (CRVO). Ho et al. (1) reported, that pooled data showed prevalence rates of about 0.52% for any RVO, 0.44% for BRVO, and 0.08% for CRVO. BRVO is caused by a combination of vein compression at arteriovenous crossings, degenerative changes within venous walls, and hypercoagulability. 34% of nonischemic retinal vein occlusion converted to the ischemic type. Kokolaki et al. (2) showed, that collateral vessels developed in 60% of patients 6±3 months after diagnosis.

Patient: 13 years of age, male, BCVA 1.0 at OD, 0.6 at OS.
Ocular Medical History: Young boy projected a handheld green laser pointer (532 nm green laser light, power < 5 mW, Class III Laser) through a window at the street. The reflected light from the glass leaded to a bilateral exposure of the macula. Two months later without any systemic therapy we found an instrinsic repair. 
General Medical History: empty.
Main Complant: decreased vision after exposure to a green laser pointer.
Purpose: to present instrinsic repair of Laser pointer maculopathy. 
Methods: Colour Image Posterior Pole, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography  OCT, Fluorescein angiography FFA
Findings:
Colour Image Posterior Pole: just after laser exposure yellowish round spot in the foveal area.
Colour Image Posterior Pole: two months after laser exposure partial resolution yellowish round spot, persistent alterations at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium.
OCT: just after laser exposure disruption of the external limiting membrane, impairment of photoreceptor zone of the inner segments, and interdigitation zone.
OCT: two months after laser exposure partial resolution of the outer retinal disruption compared to initial visit with persistent, small foveal photoreceptor defects, residual disruption of the outer retinal layer at the fovea remained unchanged.
FFA: two months after laser exposure increased central avascular zone, late ill-defined leakage. 
Discussion: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 4 major classes of lasers (I–IV), of which the laser pointers belong to class IIIA (1). Diode laser pointers of red–orange (633–650 nm wavelength) are safer than the green–blue (400–500 nm). Injuries to the eye can occur within few seconds when the exposed to class III lasers that emit up to 5 mW power. Hossein et al. (2) reported, that after treatment with a systemic high-dose corticosteroid the initially visible hyperreflective band in the foveal region disappeared.

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

Ocular Medical History: in 01/2012 fast reduction of VA at OS after systemic therapy over three weeks with meropenem (Meronem®, vancomycin und linezolid (Zyvoxid®).
Main Complaint: reduction of VA in OS.
Findings:
1) Colour Photography: bilateral optic nerve atrophy (OS>OD).
2) VEP: decreased amplitudes und prolonged latencies.
3) OCT: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.
Discussion:
It was reported (1,2), that antibiotic therapy with Linezolid (Zyvoxid®) can cause optic nerve atrophy. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, used against infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may lead to progressive, potentially irreversible neuropathies of the optic nerve especially in long-time application.
Linezolid is part of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal initiation complex. Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm. 
Symptomatic choroidal metastases is a rare presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Choroidal metastases (CM) are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. CM is detected in 2% to 7% of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is generally discovered at the end-stage of the disease. Singh et al. (2) reported the demographic profile, histology, disease stage, ocular and lung lesions, diagnostic and treatment (systemic and ocular) modalities, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer : 67% of patients were male and 78% were current or ex-smokers, mean age was 55 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type followed by squamous and small cell. Bilateral involvement was rare (<10%). Ocular treatment modalities included radiation, enucleation, and systemic steroids. Regression of choroidal metastases with treatment was observed in 67% of patients who did not undergo enucleation.

Discussion:
It was shown by Liu et al. (1) that progression and regression of DR were strongly associated with blood pressure and glycemic exposure.  In a huge study they investigated the progression and regression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the effects of population risk factors on the rates of transition across retinopathy stages. From 1990 to 2011   4,758 diabetic patients who were diagnosed at 35 years of age or older were observed. They found a consistent risk effect of HbA1c on the progression  from no retinopathy to mild background DR a hazard ratio per SD of HbA1c  of 1.42, from mild BDR to observable BDR a hazard ratio of 1.32, and from observable BDR to severe nonproliferative/proliferative DR a hazard ratio of 2.23. Similarly, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure increased the risk for the transition from the asymptomatic phase to mild BDR  with a hazard ratio of 1.20 and from the mild BDR to observable BDR with a hazard ratio of 1.87, respectively. Regression from mild BDR to no DR was associated with lower SBP and lower HbA1c .

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

Main complaint: Decrease of visual acuity (OS>OD).
Ocular medical history: at OS central scotoma since two weeks.
General medical history: Bone marrow biopsy showing chronic myelogenous leukemia. The laboratory evaluation depicting white blood cell count of 620.000. Chemotherapy was initiated.
Methods: Color photography, SD-OCT (HE, Germany).
Findings:
(1) Fundoscopic examination of OS: optic disc edema, retinal venous tortuousity and dilatation, retinal blot and flame-shaped hemorrhages, Roth spots.
(2) SD-OCT of optic nerve head, OS: optic disc edema.
(3) SD-OCT of macula: central and peripheral infiltrates. 
Discussion:
Retinopathy in Chronic Myeloic Leukemia („Fundus leucaemicus“) is often associated with reduction of visual acuity. The ocular manifestations are unspecific, but characteristic for severe systemic diseases. Color fundus photograph show marked venous dilatation and tortuosity, cotton wool spots, and multiple retinal, preretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots. Large whitish retinal masses present temporally with satellite lesions at the posterior border are suggestive of retinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is helpful for quantification of the pathological retinal changes. Peripheral blood counts and differential haemograms are seminal for the diagnosis of CML. First line therapy for CML is the application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Glivec). Ophthalmological adverse effects of this therapy, such as periorbital edema, are possible (1,2) .

Discussion: Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity across the world. This condition complicates approximately 3% to 7% of pregnancies, and the severe form affects 0.6% to 1.2% of pregnancies. Preeclampsia can cause grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy with hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, hard exudates in the macular region, and swelling of the optic disks. The severe preeclampsia variant, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), occurs in approximately 20-25% of women with severe preeclampsia . It is named not only for the liver involvement but also for the disorder of the coagulation system which develops. Approximately 20% of women with HELLP syndrome develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, which carries a poor prognosis for both mother and fetus. Conditions other than preeclampsia can cause serous retinal detachments and choroidal thickening. Central serous retinopathy is hypothesized to be due to an overactivation of mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in the choroidal vasculature.

Discussion: Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity across the world. This condition complicates approximately 3% to 7% of pregnancies, and the severe form affects 0.6% to 1.2% of pregnancies. Preeclampsia can cause grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy with hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, hard exudates in the macular region, and swelling of the optic disks. The severe preeclampsia variant, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), occurs in approximately 20-25% of women with severe preeclampsia . It is named not only for the liver involvement but also for the disorder of the coagulation system which develops. Approximately 20% of women with HELLP syndrome develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, which carries a poor prognosis for both mother and fetus. Conditions other than preeclampsia can cause serous retinal detachments and choroidal thickening. Central serous retinopathy is hypothesized to be due to an overactivation of mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in the choroidal vasculature.

Patient: 56 years of age, female BCVA 1.0 at OD; 0.1 at OS; IOP 15/16 mmHg
General Medical History: -.
Ocular Medical History: control of longlasting unilateral corectopia.
Purpose: to show bilateral choroidal coloboma with unilateral iridal coloboma.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, Colour Photography Anterior Segment, SD-OCT.
Findings: 
SD-OCT: bilateral  choroidal coloboma. 
Colour Photography Posterior Segment of OD: coloboma located in the equatorial region with attached retina along the margin of the coloboma.
Colour Photography Anterior Segment of OS: inferior corectopia upon light-induced miosis. 
Colour Photography Anterior Segment of OS: dilated pupil showing cataract, sectorial iridal coloboma and sectorial zonulalysis.
SD-OCT of OD: margin of choroidal coloboma appearance of a hump owing to inward turning of the retinochoroidal layers, no thickening of the layers at the margin.
Discussion: Ocular coloboma is a common malformation. It includes a spectrum of anomalies that ranges from iris coloboma to clinical anophthalmos. Coloboma is etiologically heterogeneous. The spectrum  can vary from small colobomas located in the equatorial region that do not interfere with vision, to large colobomas involving the disc and macula with severe impairment of vision. Choroidal coloboma is a congenital defect caused by defective closure of embryonal fissure, which normally takes place during the 6th week of gestation. As an isolated defect, it is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs (1, 3). Gopal L et al. (2) described choroidal colobomas. Genetic as well as environmental causes have been proposed to cause an intrauterine insult that can lead to defective closure of the embryonal fissure leading to coloboma of the fundus (3). Histologically, the colobomatous area is deficient in normal choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and the retina.

Discussion: 
Deposition of melanin granules on the corneal endothelium (Krukenberg spindle) is risk factor for glaucoma. Primary pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is a condition usually seen in younger myopic males that is characterized by radial defects of the iris pigment epithelium visible on retroillumination, with liberation and deposition of melanin granules on the corneal endothelium (Krukenberg spindle), on the posterior lens capsule, and in the trabecular meshwork and it is frequently associated with secondary open-angle glaucoma, and also referred to as pigmentary glaucoma, which is believed to be caused by melanin granules that, after being released from the iris pigment epithelium into the aqueous humor, lead to obstruction of the aqueous outflow pathways. The degree of retrocorneal Krukenberg spindle, are graded semiquantitatively by means of the following scale: not present, trace, mild, moderate, and marked. Extensive dispersion of melanin granules, sometimes associated with a marked rise of intraocular pressure, has been described after medical pupillary dilation

05/2013: No changes in its appearance were noticed.
Discussion:
The caruncle is a nodular structure lying at the internal canthus, medial to the plica semilunaris. The caruncle is widely exposed in the palpebral aperture. Patients or physicians easily notice changes in its appearance. It was reported the types and incidence of caruncular lesions (1) of a total of 195 consecutive caruncular lesions from 191 patients. The most common type were nevi (47%) and papillomas (15%). They found that 94% were benign, 3% were premalignant, and 2.6% were malignant. It was concluded, that malignancy is clinically overestimated, and some malignant lesions can take a benign aspect, justifying close photographic follow-up of all lesions. Because caruncular malignant melanoma is associated with poor prognosis, pigmented lesions should be monitored carefully. In the absence of clear criteria for malignancy, any change in color, size, or vascularization of a caruncular lesion should hasten excision.

The caruncle is a nodular structure lying at the internal canthus, medial to the plica semilunaris. The caruncle is widely exposed in the palpebral aperture. Patients or physicians easily notice changes in its appearance. It was reported the types and incidence of caruncular lesions (1) of a total of 195 consecutive caruncular lesions from 191 patients. The most common type were nevi (47%) and papillomas (15%). They found that 94% were benign, 3% were premalignant, and 2.6% were malignant. It was concluded, that malignancy is clinically overestimated, and some malignant lesions can take a benign aspect, justifying close photographic follow-up of all lesions. Because caruncular malignant melanoma is associated with poor prognosis, pigmented lesions should be monitored carefully. In the absence of clear criteria for malignancy, any change in color, size, or vascularization of a caruncular lesion should hasten excision.

Intrastromal corneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation was performed. Major surgical procedures: Two 0.45 mm ICRS were implanted (Intacs, Addition Technology, Inc., Des Plaines, IL). The corneal channels were created with a femtosecond laser (iFS, Abbott Medical Optics Inc., Santa Ana, CA). The channel depth was set at 356 microns, 70% of the average pachymetry within the 6-9mm diameter zone (Orbscan II). A single 10-0 nylon suture was used to close the wound. One day after surgery, the BSCVA was improved. On the one month follow-up, the patient complained of eye irritation. To prevent further dissection into the optical zone, both segments were explanted. 

Main Complaint:T After surgery patient complained decreased visual acuity in both eyes without pain. 
Purpose: To report a case of unusual complication of ring segments migrated infranasally after 
Methods:Colour Image, optical coherence tomography (OCT, RTVue, Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA), Orbscan II.
Findings: 
Preoperative Findings:
Scanning-slit tomography/topography (Orbscan II, Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) showed moderate inferior steepening. 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT, RTVue, Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA): central pachymetry 429 µm
Orbscan II: showing average corneal thickness within 6-9 mm annual zone of 509 µm with minimum 486 µm. 

Postoperative Findings: 
One day after surgery
BSCVA: improving to 20/40. 
Slit lamp: showing ring segments in proper position. 

On the one month follow-up:
BSCVA: patient complained of eye irritation, BSCVA was 20/40-1.  
Slit lamp: showing both ring segments migrated infranasally, causing the tips to overlap.  At the point of overlap the intrastromal channels were widened and the tip of the inferotemporal segment had migrated centrally into the optical zone (Figure 1, 2). No edema or infiltration was observed.  
OCT: showing that both segments remained within the lamellar plane of the channel, and the relative depth of ring segments was 76% as measured at the inner edge (Figure 3). 

One day after removing the ICRS segment:
BSCVA: VA was 20/40+1.
Slit Lamp: The cornea had returned to its preoperative appearance except for faint haze in the ICRS channel.
 
Discussion: 
One of the most common complications of ICRS implantation is ring segment displacement. Two previous studies reported the complications after mechanical channel creation.  Kanellopoulos et al reported in 2006 six out of 20 keratoconus cases (30%) had ring segments movement about 3-6 months postoperatively.1 Such high incidence was not reported in other studies. Zare et al reported in 2007 ring segments displacement occurred in three out of 30 keratoconus cases (10%)  3-5 months after ICRS implantation.2 The reported incidence of ring segment migration with femtosecond laser channel creation was much lower. Coskunseven et al reported in 2011 that among 850 eyes, ring segment movement was observed in 11 (1.3%) cases at 2 months postoperatively.3 In these reported cases of ring migration, the movement was within the surgically created channel or incisional wound, or associated with corneal thinning and melting superficial to the segments,1,2 or protrusion through the Descemet’s membrane, 4 or even perforation into the anterior chamber.5 Dissection through the lateral wall of the channel had not been explicitly described. 
In our case, dissection of the ring segments in the corneal stromal happened one month after ICRS implantation, which is earlier than the range of 2-6 months reported in previous studies.2,3,6 There was intra-channel rotation of one segment while the other segment dissection along the lamellar plane of the channel toward the optical zone, which had not been reported before.  Several factors could have contributed to this pattern of dissection.  One is the thickness of the segments.  The 450 µm thick segments that was used was the maximum available, and only recently approved by the FDA for use in the US.  The thicker segment and overlapping tip could have created greater stress to split the cornea along the lamellar plane.  Another factor was the 76% depth.   Inter-lamellar corneal fibers decrease posteriorly and therefore deeper lamellar planes are easier to dissection.  Another factor was the relatively advanced nature of keratoconus in this case, with only 429 µm corneal thickness centrally.  Although this is above the 400 µm minimum needed to qualify for Intacs, it is thinner than most cases of ICRS implantation.5,7 
In conclusion, thick ICRS segments, deep implantation depth, and thin cornea may be the risk factors for lateral dissection and migration of ICRS segments. This suggests that ICRS may be safer for less advanced cases of keratoconus.

General Medical History: empty.
Ocular Medical History: no visual problems, routine checkup to rule out glaucoma.
Main Complaint: no complaints.
PURPOSE:  To describe a peripapillary and macular retinoschisis, only visible by OCT.
Methods: Colour fundus photography, w-w-perimetry (Octopus G1), fluorescein angiography (HRA, Heidelberg Engineering),  SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering).
Colour fundus photography: no glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy, no epiretinal gliosis.
W-w-perimetry : peripheral scotoma.
Frequency Doubling Technique FDT: paracentral scotoma.
OCT: large peripapillary retinoschisis, including the macular area,  mimicking a true retinoschisis cavity, although bridging retinal elements were identifiable. Cavity within cup suggests optic pit (arrow). No evidence of choroidal neovascular membrane.
Fluorescein Angiography : showing minor  leakage on fluorescein angiography within the optic disk (arrow), indicating location of the cavity. No evidence of choroidal neovascular membrane.

Discussion: 
The etiology of the peripapillary and macular retinoschisis is uncertain. There was no history of acute rises in IOP. A congenital optic pit could not be found by ophthalmoscopy. We hypothesized that there might be a communicating bridge connecting the cavity within the optic nerve head and the peripapillary  retinoschisis, which was found in  the fluorescein angiography .  Zumbro et al  (1) hypothesized that fluctuations in IOP played a role in vitreous traction and the development of retinoschisis. They supposed that acute elevations in IOP may have led to small changes in axial length or severe optic nerve cupping that allowed vitreous to enter the retina. As there were no severe fluctuations in IOP of our case, but a minor leakage in the optic cup was observed, we believe that the retinoretinoschisis is the result of a structural defect in the optic nerve in the optic disk. Microholes in the thinning and structural defects areas in the optic cup allowed liquid vitreous to enter the retina via the nerve fiber layer. The fluid caused retinal edema, followed by  a retinoschisis. Macular and peripapillary retinoschisis can occur in patients with presumed enlarged optic nerve head cups in the absence of obvious congenital anomalies of the disk. We believe the cause is leakage of fluid through a tiny hole in the thin tissue of the cup. This is a similar mechanism to that seen in patients with optic pits

General Medical History: Hashimoto thyreoditis.
Ocular Medical History: in 2005 parapapillary bleedings with regular visual fields, the 24h-IOP profiles were always 14-16 mmHg at OD and OS without any therapy, there was a regular cerebral MRI . 
Main complaint: parapapillary bleedings.
Purpose: to show transition from pre-perimetric to perimetric glaucoma  with a clear glaucomatous change in the optic nerve head over an interval of 7 years  from 2006 to 2013.
Methods: Fundus Colour Image, w-w-Perimetry  30° Octopus G1, SD-OCT Heidelberg Engineering.
Findings:
Colour fundus imaging: showing a structural progression of the optic nerve head over 7 years  from 2006 to 2013, depicting in 2013 a parapapillary hemorrhage at 11h with minor changes in the retinal pigment epithelium.
Visual field : showing minor changes in the visual fields from 2006 to 2007, and in 2008 a clear scotoma. Over 7 years there was a mean loss of 1,2 dB/year and a functional defect of -8.7% per year with an acceleration in the last 3 years.
SD-OCT: showing in 2008 a localized  defect at 7h, in 2013 a general atrophy and a deep defect at 7h of the retinal fiber layer. The retinal nerve fiber layer showed a decrease from 79 µm to 65 µma over 6 years.

Dicussion: 
In POAG the loss of neuroretinal rim area per year could be very small. Mardin  (1) described, that a  glaucoma induced rim loss is very small per year and should be differentiated from regular age-related loss. The most pronounced loss in glaucoma  is temporal, both superior and inferior. Bengtsson et al (2) examined distributions of rates of progression from visual field series in pseudophakic eyes by Octopus perimeter (Haag Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland). They found in glaucoma patients a mean loss of 2.7%/year with the mean defect index MDI.

Discussion:
Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS ) has been considered an inflammatory disease of the RPE or deep retina . MEWDS is an acute, usually unilateral  chorioretinopathy with varying degrees of retinal and choroidal involvement and with multiple yellow or white spots in the fundus. Patients report blurred vision, photopsia, or visual field defects. The cause is unknown.  Hyperfluorescence in fluorescein angiography was interpreted to be hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris. Li et al. (1) followed seven patients with unilateral MEWDS. He found during 1.5 weeks to 6 months follow-up, the BCVA returned to 1.0 along with resolution of the white dots in all patients.

No peripheral corneal thinning, anterior chamber quiet and deep.


Patient:71-year-old Caucasian woman, BCVA 0.3 at OD, 0.3 at OS; IOP 12/14 mmHg.
Ocular Medical History: 2-year history of redness, irritation, and foreign body sensation in both eyes, treated with topical corticosteroids without improvement.
General medical history: presented due to ocular symptoms but, on initial evaluation were found systemic manifestations consistent with Wegener granulomatosis, diagnosed on the basis of clinical and histopathologic features. The patient was treated with Rituximap 1000 mg and oral prednisone, 25 mg/day. Recurrent pulmonary inflammation developed and serologies for cytoplasmic-pattern antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) became positive.
Main complaints: ocular irritation for the previous year, conjunctival and scleral ulceration of the left eye
PURPOSE: To describe a patient with Wegener granulomatosis, presented due to ocular symptoms but, on initial evaluation were found to have occult systemic manifestations.
Findings:
Colour photography anterior segment (OS): diffuse conjunctival injection, focal vasculitis manifested by scleritis. No peripheral corneal thinning, anterior chamber quiet and deep.
Discussion:
In Wegener granulomatosis focal vasculitis is manifested by conjunctivitis, episcleritis, scleritis, corneoscleral ulceration, uveitis, and granulomatous vasculitis of the retina and optic nerve. Although ocular manifestations are relatively common in Wegener granulomatosis, the eyelid and its conjunctival lining are rarely involved (1). When this area is the initial focus of the disease, diagnosis may be difficult. Wegener granulomatosis has a variety of uncommon initial presentations. Although conjunctival involvement in this condition is rare, the diagnosis of Wegener granulomatosis should be suspected when the conjunctival inflammation is recurrent and not typical of other conjunctival inflammatory conditions. Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is an etiologically obscure entity with multiple systemic manifestations. Ocular involvement is present in up to 58% of patients with WG. Harper et al (2) reported from 47 patients diagnosed with WG: 57.4% had systemic disease first and subsequently developed an ocular lesion, 6.3% had ocular inflammation first and then subsequently developed systemic manifestations of WG,  6.3% presented due to ocular symptoms but, on initial evaluation were found to have occult systemic manifestations consistent with WG, 30% had ocular lesions and no history or presence of systemic disease. He concluded, that ocular inflammation can occur with or without obvious systemic manifestations of WG. Ocular inflammation may represent the first sign of WG that enables the knowledgeable physician to diagnose this potentially lethal disease.

Discussion:
It was shown by Liu et al. (1) that progression and regression of DR were strongly associated with blood pressure and glycemic exposure.  In a huge study they investigated the progression and regression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the effects of population risk factors on the rates of transition across retinopathy stages. From 1990 to 2011   4,758 diabetic patients who were diagnosed at 35 years of age or older were observed. They found a consistent risk effect of HbA1c on the progression  from no retinopathy to mild background DR a hazard ratio per SD of HbA1c  of 1.42, from mild BDR to observable BDR a hazard ratio of 1.32, and from observable BDR to severe nonproliferative/proliferative DR a hazard ratio of 2.23. Similarly, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure increased the risk for the transition from the asymptomatic phase to mild BDR  with a hazard ratio of 1.20 and from the mild BDR to observable BDR with a hazard ratio of 1.87, respectively. Regression from mild BDR to no DR was associated with lower SBP and lower HbA1c .

Discussion:
Nodular scleritis can present as isolated condition or as part of a systemic inflammatory or infectious disorder. It is a serious ocular condition that can result in vision loss. Two-thirds of patients with non-infectious scleritis require systemic glucocorticoid therapy, and one fourth need a glucocorticoid-sparing agent, as well. Jabs et al (1) reported  in a retrospective study of 97 patients with scleritis, that 30% required nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone, 31% required oral glucocorticoids, and 26% required immunosuppressive drugs in addition to glucocorticoids to control their disease. Nodular anterior scleritis responded more often to NSAIDs (57%), whereas necrotizing scleritis often required systemic immunosuppressive drugs (70%).  Scleritis can occur in any age group but usually presents between ages 30 and 50  and women are affected approximately twice more often than men. There is no racial or geographic predilection. There is no known HLA association. The prevalence of scleritis in the general population is estimated to be 6 cases per 100,000 people. It has been described up to 7% of those with Wegener’s granulomatosis. Fong et al (2) discussed the pathogenesis of scleritis. They found that  the data available support an important  role for T cells in the inflammatory process. Inflammatory cells, mostly T cells and macrophages, are found on biopsy specimens.

Discussion
Differentiating ischemic CRVO from nonischemic CRVO is crucial. Fluorescein fundus angiography during the early acute phase of CRVO provided reliable information about retinal capillary nonperfusion in approximately 60% of cases.  Visual outcome is good in nonischemic CRVO and poor in ischemic CRVO. Hayreh (1) suggested, that a clear differentiation of CRVO into nonischemic and ischemic types, based primarily on functional criteria, is fundamental in determining visual outcome. He reported that visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 78% with nonischemic CRVO and in only 1% with ischemic CRVO. Final visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 83% with nonischemic CRVO and in only 12% with ischemic CRVO. Of 100% eyes with nonischemic CRVO, about 10% converted to the ischemic type. Hayreh reported, that there was a higher prevalence of history of cerebrovascular disease in those that converted from nonischemic to ischemic CRVO. Most CRVO eyes start as nonischemic and some convert later to ischemic CRVO.

Colour image showing only few intraretinal hemorrhages. 

The retinal microaneurysm is a hallmark of diabetic retinopathy, although the pathogenesis of this vascular abnormality remains incompletely elucidated. Vascular BM damage, endothelial proliferation,changes in intraluminal rheology, and pericyte cell death have all been implicated as causal or contributory factors. Of these various changes, selective pericyte loss appears to be critical, since several independent studies have demonstrated that microaneurysms invariably lack viable pericytes (1) .Haiyan Wang et al. (2) showed, that the majority of diabetic microaneurysms were found at 37% ± 10% depth from the inner retinal surface. External diameter of microaneurysms averaged 104 μm (range 43-266 μm).

Discussion: 
Choi et al. (1) reported that optic disc pits had a diverse structure according to the alteration of the lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue. Optic disc pit is often associated with a corresponding scotoma. Choi et al. (1) suggested, that a compliant lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue may become susceptible to the damaging effects of increased IOP values. The ongoing insult to the optic nerve may then influence the lamina cribrosa tissue or prelaminar tissue, exhibiting the appearance of alteration in the lamina cribrosa or or prelaminar tissue. Subsequently, the axons passing through the altered lamina cribrosa and or prelaminar tissue are likely to be damaged by loss of structural support, loss of nutrient supply from laminar capillaries, or loss of metabolic support from astrocytes.

Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

___Discussion:  In presented case the increased foveolar avascular zone and the rarefication of macular capillaries  in OD may be caused by the venous vascular dysregulation, and glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy. Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy with optic nerve deterioration, visual field defects, and vascular dysregulation and rarefication. Müller et al. and Zivkovicet al. investigated macular capillaries in glaucoma by OCT-angiography. Zivkovic M et al. (2) measured foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in NTG and healthy subjects. He reported that mean horizontal, mean vertical diameter, and FAZ area were significantly enlarged in the NTG group. Müller et al. (1)  investigated central macular microvasculature in glaucoma patients. He found in perimetric glaucoma patients significantly reduced density maps of superficial foveal flow.

(2) SD-OCT of optic nerve head, OS: optic disc edema.
(3) SD-OCT of macula: central and peripheral infiltrates. 
Discussion:
Retinopathy in Chronic Myeloic Leukemia („Fundus leucaemicus“) is often associated with reduction of visual acuity. The ocular manifestations are unspecific, but characteristic for severe systemic diseases. Color fundus photograph show marked venous dilatation and tortuosity, cotton wool spots, and multiple retinal, preretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots. Large whitish retinal masses present temporally with satellite lesions at the posterior border are suggestive of retinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is helpful for quantification of the pathological retinal changes. Peripheral blood counts and differential haemograms are seminal for the diagnosis of CML. First line therapy for CML is the application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Glivec). Ophthalmological adverse effects of this therapy, such as periorbital edema, are possible (1,2) .

Main Complaint: loss of vision at OS.
Purpose: to present optic nerve head edema followed by atrophy as a consequence of maxillary sinusitis.
Methods: colour fundus photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), MRI (SiemensTrio), w-w-perimetry (Octpus G1).
Findings:
Colour photography, in October 2012: presenting an unilateral optic nerve head edema  with a parapapillary bleeding at 7h at OS 
SD-OCT, in October 2012: showing an edema of the optic nerve head at OS.
MRI, in October 2012: depicting a complete complete filling of left maxillary and frontal sinus.
W-w-perimetry, in November 2012: presenting a deep and large scotoma at OS.
SD-OCT, in March 2013: showing a decreased retinal nerve fiber layer at OS, and no edema of optic nerve head.
Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

Discussion: In general pits of the optic nerve head (OPD) are oval cavities or depressions in the optic disc. Itis a herniation of dysplastic retinal tissue into a collagen rich excavation extending into the subarachnoid space through a defect in the lamina cribrosa.  Pits of the optic nerve can appear as a localized pit-like invagination in the optic disc. They can be congenital or acquired. ODPs can remain clinically asymptomatic in many cases. In about 50% patients with ODPs develop optic disc pit related maculopathy with retinoschisis, atrophy of inner retinal layers, serous macular detachment and significant loss of vision. 1-2

Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

(2) VEP of OS showed regular latencies with attenuated amplitudes at OS.
Discussion: Bonavolontà  et al. (1) evaluated the frequencies of orbital space-occupying lesions. In this retrospective case series, the authors reviewed 2,480 consecutive patients. Of the 2,480 lesions, 68% were benign and 32% were malignant. The most frequent benign tumors were dermoid cyst (14%) and cavernous hemangioma (9%). The most common malignant tumors were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (12%), basal cell carcinoma (3%), and orbital metastases (3%). Cavernous hemangioma only exceptionally compresses the optic nerve.

Slit lamp photo showing overlap of the two ring segments that widened the channel, creating a fluid space.  However, the anterior (white arrow) and posterior (red arrow) walls of the channel remained intact. 

Patient: Female subject, 49 years old, preoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) 20/60 in left eye. 
Ocular Medical History: The patient was unable to tolerate rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens and chose ICRS implantation to improve vision. Intrastromal corneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation was performed. Major surgical procedures: Two 0.45 mm ICRS were implanted (Intacs, Addition Technology, Inc., Des Plaines, IL). The corneal channels were created with a femtosecond laser (iFS, Abbott Medical Optics Inc., Santa Ana, CA). The channel depth was set at 356 microns, 70% of the average pachymetry within the 6-9mm diameter zone (Orbscan II). A single 10-0 nylon suture was used to close the wound. One day after surgery, the BSCVA was improved. On the one month follow-up, the patient complained of eye irritation. To prevent further dissection into the optical zone, both segments were explanted. 

Main Complaint:T After surgery patient complained decreased visual acuity in both eyes without pain. 
Purpose: To report a case of unusual complication of ring segments migrated infranasally after 
Methods:Colour Image, optical coherence tomography (OCT, RTVue, Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA), Orbscan II.
Findings: 
Preoperative Findings:
Scanning-slit tomography/topography (Orbscan II, Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) showed moderate inferior steepening. 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT, RTVue, Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA): central pachymetry 429 µm
Orbscan II: showing average corneal thickness within 6-9 mm annual zone of 509 µm with minimum 486 µm. 

Postoperative Findings: 
One day after surgery
BSCVA: improving to 20/40. 
Slit lamp: showing ring segments in proper position. 

On the one month follow-up:
BSCVA: patient complained of eye irritation, BSCVA was 20/40-1.  
Slit lamp: showing both ring segments migrated infranasally, causing the tips to overlap.  At the point of overlap the intrastromal channels were widened and the tip of the inferotemporal segment had migrated centrally into the optical zone (Figure 1, 2). No edema or infiltration was observed.  
OCT: showing that both segments remained within the lamellar plane of the channel, and the relative depth of ring segments was 76% as measured at the inner edge (Figure 3). 

One day after removing the ICRS segment:
BSCVA: VA was 20/40+1.
Slit Lamp: The cornea had returned to its preoperative appearance except for faint haze in the ICRS channel.
 
Discussion: 
One of the most common complications of ICRS implantation is ring segment displacement. Two previous studies reported the complications after mechanical channel creation.  Kanellopoulos et al reported in 2006 six out of 20 keratoconus cases (30%) had ring segments movement about 3-6 months postoperatively.1 Such high incidence was not reported in other studies. Zare et al reported in 2007 ring segments displacement occurred in three out of 30 keratoconus cases (10%)  3-5 months after ICRS implantation.2 The reported incidence of ring segment migration with femtosecond laser channel creation was much lower. Coskunseven et al reported in 2011 that among 850 eyes, ring segment movement was observed in 11 (1.3%) cases at 2 months postoperatively.3 In these reported cases of ring migration, the movement was within the surgically created channel or incisional wound, or associated with corneal thinning and melting superficial to the segments,1,2 or protrusion through the Descemet’s membrane, 4 or even perforation into the anterior chamber.5 Dissection through the lateral wall of the channel had not been explicitly described. 
In our case, dissection of the ring segments in the corneal stromal happened one month after ICRS implantation, which is earlier than the range of 2-6 months reported in previous studies.2,3,6 There was intra-channel rotation of one segment while the other segment dissection along the lamellar plane of the channel toward the optical zone, which had not been reported before.  Several factors could have contributed to this pattern of dissection.  One is the thickness of the segments.  The 450 µm thick segments that was used was the maximum available, and only recently approved by the FDA for use in the US.  The thicker segment and overlapping tip could have created greater stress to split the cornea along the lamellar plane.  Another factor was the 76% depth.   Inter-lamellar corneal fibers decrease posteriorly and therefore deeper lamellar planes are easier to dissection.  Another factor was the relatively advanced nature of keratoconus in this case, with only 429 µm corneal thickness centrally.  Although this is above the 400 µm minimum needed to qualify for Intacs, it is thinner than most cases of ICRS implantation.5,7 
In conclusion, thick ICRS segments, deep implantation depth, and thin cornea may be the risk factors for lateral dissection and migration of ICRS segments. This suggests that ICRS may be safer for less advanced cases of keratoconus.

Paecilomyces is a rare cause of keratitis, but is an emerging fungal pathogen that infects corneal tissue by filamentous invasion with occasional intrastromal sporulation. The infection is difficult to eradicate because of multiple antifungal drug resistance and has a poor outcome.  Yuan et al . (1) described  the pathogenesis and outcome of Paecilomyces keratitis. He found, that of 42 reported eyes with Paecilomyces keratitis, 31% were associated with chronic keratopathy or previous ocular surgery, 26% followed corneal trauma, and 24% occurred in soft contact lens wearers. In vitro testing indicated resistance to natamycin and amphotericin B but susceptibility to ketoconazole and voriconazole. The study stated, that Paecilomyces keratitis  does not reliably respond to natamycin or amphotericin B and has often required therapeutic keratoplasty, but topical azole antifungal agents such as voriconazole appear promising.

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

Ocular Medical History: regular pseudophakia.
Main Complaint: altered visual field to the left side.
Purpose: to demonstrate complete visual field defect to the left side after posterior cerebral artery infarction.
Methods: Colour Photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), ww-Perimetry (Octopus G1), MRT (Siemens, TimTrio).

MRI: in 11/2013 complete infarction of posterior cerebral artery (T1) (star).
MRI-DTI: in 01/2014 decreased axonal integrity in posterior part of optic radiation (arrow). 
Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

Purpose: to present a focal island of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule with a reproducible glaucoma-like visual field defect.
Methods: Colour Photography Anterior Segment, Visual Field, OCT.
Findings:

Visual Field: superior scotoma mimicking a reproducible glaucomatous visual field defect.
OCT:  Regular retinal nerve fiber thickness.
Discussion:  
Island of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule were common postoperatively. A focal collection of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule can mimic a glaucomatous visual field defect. García-Medina JJ  et al.

Purpose: to present anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in both eyes in giant cell arteritis.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT.
Findings:

Colour Photography Posterior Segment OS: sectoral swelling and blurred border at 6h, no hemorrhage around the disc rim.
OCT OD: diffused optic disc swelling with almost total disappearance of the physiological cup, ONH fiber crowding. 
OCT OS: sectorial peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer edema at 6h. 

Discussion:
Arteritis temporalis shows a variable course of the disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss. Hayeh et al. (1) reported, that patients with giant cell arteritis presented a variety of ocular symptoms : visual loss of varying severity in 98%, amaurosis fugax in 31%, diplopia in 6%, and eye pain in 8%. Because giant cell arteritis is a potentially blinding disease and its early diagnosis is the key to preventing blindness, it is important to recognize its various ocular manifestations. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ infarction (2).

General Medical History: empty.
Ocular Medical History: no visual problems, routine checkup to rule out glaucoma.
Main Complaint: no complaints.
PURPOSE:  To describe a peripapillary and macular retinoschisis, only visible by OCT.
Methods: Colour fundus photography, w-w-perimetry (Octopus G1), fluorescein angiography (HRA, Heidelberg Engineering),  SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering).
Colour fundus photography: no glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy, no epiretinal gliosis.
W-w-perimetry : peripheral scotoma.
Frequency Doubling Technique FDT: paracentral scotoma.
OCT: large peripapillary retinoschisis, including the macular area,  mimicking a true retinoschisis cavity, although bridging retinal elements were identifiable. Cavity within cup suggests optic pit (arrow). No evidence of choroidal neovascular membrane.
Fluorescein Angiography : showing minor  leakage on fluorescein angiography within the optic disk (arrow), indicating location of the cavity. No evidence of choroidal neovascular membrane.

Discussion: 
The etiology of the peripapillary and macular retinoschisis is uncertain. There was no history of acute rises in IOP. A congenital optic pit could not be found by ophthalmoscopy. We hypothesized that there might be a communicating bridge connecting the cavity within the optic nerve head and the peripapillary  retinoschisis, which was found in  the fluorescein angiography .  Zumbro et al  (1) hypothesized that fluctuations in IOP played a role in vitreous traction and the development of retinoschisis. They supposed that acute elevations in IOP may have led to small changes in axial length or severe optic nerve cupping that allowed vitreous to enter the retina. As there were no severe fluctuations in IOP of our case, but a minor leakage in the optic cup was observed, we believe that the retinoretinoschisis is the result of a structural defect in the optic nerve in the optic disk. Microholes in the thinning and structural defects areas in the optic cup allowed liquid vitreous to enter the retina via the nerve fiber layer. The fluid caused retinal edema, followed by  a retinoschisis. Macular and peripapillary retinoschisis can occur in patients with presumed enlarged optic nerve head cups in the absence of obvious congenital anomalies of the disk. We believe the cause is leakage of fluid through a tiny hole in the thin tissue of the cup. This is a similar mechanism to that seen in patients with optic pits

Discussion: 
Chlamydia trachomatis is a ubiquitos pathogen worldwide and causes ocular, urogenital and respiratory infections in humans. An estimated 92 million new cases of Chlamydia trachomatis infection occur each year (1). About 0.3%-2% of genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis are complicated by a chlamydial eye infection (2). Ocular localizations of C. trachomatis are typically observed among neonates and infants who acquire the infection while passing through the birth canal. Chlamydial conjunctivitis may also occur in adolescents following a genital infection. Chlamydial conjunctivitis affects initially one eye and the incubation period varies from 4 to 12 days.

Discussion:
Peripheral iris pigment epithelial (IPE) cysts are benign lesions of the anterior segment. IPE cysts classically remain stable without need for intervention. They are located at the iridociliary junction and can produce a localised distortion of the iris. The aetiology is unknown. They tend to be unilateral and solitary . The cyst walls are composed of iris pigment epithelium and the lumen contains clear fluid. Patients are usually asymptomatic. Peripheral iris pigment epithelial cysts must be differentiated from malignancies of the iris or ciliary body. Shields et al.  (1) reported the spectrum of iris lesions including 3680 iris tumors in 3451 patients. In this study of 3680 tumors, the diagnostic category was solid (79%) or cystic (21%). The cystic tumors originated from iris pigment epithelium (18%) or iris stroma (3%). The solid tumors included nevus (60%), melanocytoma (3%), melanoma (26%), and melanocytosis (3%). They concluded that the most common specific diagnoses of iris lesions were nevus (42%), iris pigment epithelium cyst (19%), and melanoma (17%).

Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

Pharmacologic mydriasis is characterized by rather dramatic pupillary dilation, normal eyelid and ocular motor function, and a minimal or absent response to strong miotic agents.

One should first evaluate the iris anatomy to check for sectoral iris palsy or trauma.
If diagnosis is still not made, instill 0.1% pilocarpine, if it does not constrict, it is not Adie's Pupil. Next, we suspect pharmacologic mydriasis, and to comfirm diagnosis a drop of pilocarpine 1% will not constrict the dilated pupil. If the pupil is constricted with 1% Pilocarpine a third nerve palsy is suspected.  In the case below, we present pharmacologic mydriasis

Top Photo: Before application of phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1%  in right eye. Pupils are equal in size under normal light conditions. Extraocular movements and lid function were normal. Ishihara, visual fields, Optical coherence tomography of optic nerve and macula, were normal. Vision near and distance 20/20 OU. 

Middle Photo: Before application of phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1%. Both pupils constrict normal to light when the flashlight is applied to the right eye in this photo. 

Bottom Photo: After application of phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1%, the right pupil remains fixed and dilated in all lighting situations. In this photo, the flashlight is being applied to the right eye to show the intact light reflex. Detection of an afferent pupillary defect requires only one working pupil. In this case, an intact light reflex is present because the contralateral eye (left) constricts even if the pupil is abnormal (right eye). In this case, no afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn Pupil) is present in right eye because left pupil constricts when light is applied to right pupil. 

phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1% are used to dillate pupils for eye exams and intraocular surgery because together their dilating effects last 2-8 hours. Other mydriatics such as homatropine and atropine dilate the eye for days and are useful for cycloplegic refractions and treating intraocular inflammation. Atropine ointments are used in infants because drops can be absorbed systemically more easilly and cause systemic side effects.

Patient: 63 years of age, female, BCVA 0.8 at OD, 0.9 at OS; 
General Medical History: two months before, in Nov 2013 acute infarction of posterior cerebral artery, long standing arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: regular pseudophakia.
Main Complaint: altered visual field to the left side.
Purpose: to demonstrate complete visual field defect to the left side after posterior cerebral artery infarction.
Methods: Colour Photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), ww-Perimetry (Octopus G1), MRT (Siemens, TimTrio). 
Colour Photography OD& OS: pale optic nerve head (OD>OS), no cupping.
OCT OD& OS : minimal diffuse thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer.
ww-Perimetry OD& OS : complete homonymus visual defect to the left side.
MRI: in 11/2013 complete infarction of posterior cerebral artery (T1) (star).
MRI-DTI: in 01/2014 decreased axonal integrity in posterior part of optic radiation (arrow). 
Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

Discussion: 
Rebecca L Thomas et al. (1) determined the prevalence and severity of diabetic retinopathy in a cross-sectional analysis of about 90.000 persons with diabetes. They found a prevalence of any DR and sight-threatening DR in type 2 diabetes of 30% and 3%, respectively. The presence of DR was strongly associated with increasing duration of diabetes and with insulin therapy. Stratton IM (2) combined the results from 2 consecutive years of photographic screening enabling  estimation of the risk of future development of sight threatening DR.  They found that  patients  with background DR in both eyes at both screenings, 11% per year progressed to sight threatening DR.

Discussion: 
Rebecca L Thomas et al. (1) determined the prevalence and severity of diabetic retinopathy in a cross-sectional analysis of about 90.000 persons with diabetes. They found a prevalence of any DR and sight-threatening DR in type 2 diabetes of 30% and 3%, respectively. The presence of DR was strongly associated with increasing duration of diabetes and with insulin therapy. Stratton IM (2) combined the results from 2 consecutive years of photographic screening enabling  estimation of the risk of future development of sight threatening DR.  They found that  patients  with background DR in both eyes at both screenings, 11% per year progressed to sight threatening DR.

Discussion:
Optic neuropathies in HIV patients are caused by a variety of pathologies including infectious, compressive and inflammatory processes. There is evidence that the optic nerves of HIV infected patients can undergo chronic degeneration resulting in axonal loss. The current widely accepted theory emphasises the key role of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the genesis of primary HIV optic neuropathy. The pathogenesis of neuronal damage has been ascribed to the combined effect of neurotoxic agents including viral proteins and neurotoxic factors released from activated microglia and macrophages. 
Mwanza et al. (1) found, that VEPs were abnormal in 57% and 42% of HIV infected patients with and without neurological symptoms. HIV positive patients with neurological symptoms are not at higher risk for optic nerve damage than those without neurological manifestations. This support the hypothesis according to which axonal loss of the optic nerve is a common process occurring in all HIV infected subjects. 
There is evidence suggesting that, despite normal visual acuity, HIV infected subjects may have subclinical dysfunction of the optic nerves/retrochiasmal visual pathways that can be detected using electrophysiological methods.
A loss of cortical neurons has been found in asymptomatic HIV positive subjects in early stages of the infection. These lesions as well as others affecting the retrogeniculate part of the visual pathways, especially the primary visual cortex, may result in delay in both cortical processing and signal generation and thus in VEP abnormalities.

Findings:
Colour Photography: 10 days after surgery with intraoperative use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas the surface of the resting gas bubble produces a mirror (arrow), generating a second image of the optic nerve head (*). 
Discussion: 
Gas mixtures are often used in vitrectomy surgery to tamponade the retina. In 1973, Norton proposed the use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas to provide a longer-acting gas bubble for intraocular tamponade. Pure SF6 gas expands to 1.9–2.0 times its original size because oxygen and nitrogen from the blood enter the gas bubble more rapidly than SF6 can leave the bubble. The most rapid expansion occurs over the first 6–8 hours, and maximal expansion is reached at around 24 hours. SF6 lasts in the eye for 10–14 days.

PEX syndrome is a genetically determined, generalized disease of the extracellular matrix leading to the progressive deposition of an abnormal fibrillar material in various intraocular and extraocular tissues including the trabecular meshwork. Schlötzer-Schrehardt (1) reported, that the PEX-specific fibrotic matrix process is a stress-induced elastosis. It is characterized by an excessive production and abnormal cross-linking of elastic microfibrils into fibrillar PEX aggregates. She showed, that co-modulating factors triggering this fibrotic process include elevated concentrations of fibrogenic growth factors, such as TGF-β1, reduced activity of proteolytic enzymes, subtle inflammatory processes and various external stress factors. Genetic studies identified a highly significant association between several polymorphisms in the LOXL1 (lysyl oxidase-like 1) gene with both PEX syndrome and PEX glaucoma.

This is a classical late stage of deposition of PEX-material on the anterior lens capsule. The rub off zone between the central disc and the preequatorial zone usually starts nasal superiorly- due to the contact of pupillary motility and anterior lens surface. The focal rub off is called MiniPEX. Preclinical stages of uniform precapsular layer of deposition are defined as Pex suspect. Masked PEX results from posterior circular synechiae which prevent mydriasis and then mask the inspection of the lens. Masked stage of PEX must be considered if other causes of posterior synechiae are excluded. The clinical diagnosis from inspection can be confirmed by ultrasound biomicroscopy.

Discussion: 
Jonas et al. (1) described macrodisks as similar to normal optic nerve head form but even more circular, vertical diameters larger than the horizontal, abnormally large optic cups, and abnormally high cup/disk ratios. Klein et al. (2) examined the stereoscopic pairs of photographs of optic disc, both vertical and horizontal disc and cup diameters and found a consistent and strong quantitative relationship of vertical optic cup dimensions in parents and children. He found that heritability estimates were 0.55, and 0.57 for intraocular optic cup diameter, and optic disc diameter, respectively.

The size of infiltrate was 7 mm without presence of hypopyon. 

Patient: 33 years of age, female, BCVA light perception at OD.
Ocular Medical history: wear of a daily wear rigid gas permeable contact lens. Sudden begin of subjective symptoms with decreased vision. The interval between symptoms and presentation at the hospital was 3 days. Corneal scraping was obtained.  The microbial analysis resulted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Due to a perforation of the central infiltrate the eye required corneal transplantation.

Purpose: to present corneal infiltration due to wear of contact lenses. 
Methods: Colour imaging.
Findings:
Colour image: flat anterior chamber with a central spontaneous corneal perforation combined with a stromal infiltrate. The size of infiltrate was 7 mm without presence of hypopyon. 

Discussion:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequently isolated microorganism in contact lens wearers. It was reported (1), that the estimated annual incidence of microbial keratitis per 10,000 contact lens wearers, depending on lens type and wearing schedule, ranges between 1.2 for daily wear rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses and 25.4 for extended wear of silicone hydrogel lenses. Microbial keratitis is a serious complication of contact lens wear, with approximately one out of five cases requiring corneal transplantation. Hoddenbach et al. (2) investigated the clinical presentation, isolated organism, treatment, and morbidity of contact lens-associated microbial keratitis needing hospitalization. He included 109 consecutive patients with contact lens-associated microbial keratitis from 2005 to 2009. In 69% Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated. Ofloxacin, or a combination of gentamicin and cephazolin, was suggested as an excellent first-choice therapy. In his study after intensive treatment 67 %  achieved a BCVA ≥ 0.7 Snellen and 20 % required corneal transplantation.

Ocular Medical History: intermittend increased IOP (30-40 mmHg), optic nerve atrophy, 3 weeks ago cataract surgery with cyclophoto coagulation, now pupillary block with IOP of 60 mmHg. 
General Medical History: Mucopolysaccharidosis Typ I Pfaundler-Hurler, hydrocephalus interna. 
Main Complaint: Increased IOP and decreased vision. 
Findings:
(1) Slit-lamp photograph of the right eye before laser iridotomy shows total synechiae and anterior bowing of the iris. 
(2) SL-OCT images show typical iris bombé with extensive peripheral iridocorneal contact.
(3) SL-OCT of the right eye after laser iridotomy shows deepened anterior chamber.

Iris bombé is an uncommon severe complication of uveitis. SL-OCT showed the anatomic structures of the anterior segment, including iris thickness, anterior chamber depth and the extent of anterior iris bowing before and after iridotomy. 
The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of disorders characterised by accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) within a wide variety of tissues, including those of the eye. The MPS have been subdivided into different types depending on clinical manifestations. They encompass a wide spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from those disorders, which are fatal in the first months of life to those compatible with a normal lifespan. The MPS result from inherited abnormalities of specific lysosomal enzymes involved in degradation of GAG. Mucopolysaccharidoses type I (MPS I) is caused by abnormalities of the enzyme a -L-iduronidase. Ocular hypertension and glaucoma occur in MPS due to GAG acumulation within anterior chamber structures. This can lead to narrowing of the anterior chamber angle, and deposition within trabecular cells may lead to obstruction of outflow. MPS IH Hurler syndrome presents with facial dysmorphism and respiratory disease in early life, and patients may be referred to the ophthalmologist once the diagnosis is already made for detection of associated corneal opacification. The prevalence of ocular complications in patients with MPS was retrospectively reported by Ashworth JL et al.(1). They found in MPS IH patients: in 79% visual acuity of less than 6/12 equivalent in their better eye, in 16% severe corneal opacification, in 16% optic atrophy, in 1% ocular hypertension.

Ocular Medical History: intermittend increased IOP (30-40 mmHg), optic nerve atrophy, 3 weeks ago cataract surgery with cyclophoto coagulation, now pupillary block with IOP of 60 mmHg. 
General Medical History: Mucopolysaccharidosis Typ I Pfaundler-Hurler, hydrocephalus interna. 
Main Complaint: Increased IOP and decreased vision. 
Findings:
(1) Slit-lamp photograph of the right eye before laser iridotomy shows total synechiae and anterior bowing of the iris. 
(2) SL-OCT images show typical iris bombé with extensive peripheral iridocorneal contact.
(3) SL-OCT of the right eye after laser iridotomy shows deepened anterior chamber.
Discussion:
Iris bombé is an uncommon severe complication of uveitis. SL-OCT showed the anatomic structures of the anterior segment, including iris thickness, anterior chamber depth and the extent of anterior iris bowing before and after iridotomy. 
The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of disorders characterised by accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) within a wide variety of tissues, including those of the eye. The MPS have been subdivided into different types depending on clinical manifestations. They encompass a wide spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from those disorders, which are fatal in the first months of life to those compatible with a normal lifespan. The MPS result from inherited abnormalities of specific lysosomal enzymes involved in degradation of GAG. Mucopolysaccharidoses type I (MPS I) is caused by abnormalities of the enzyme a -L-iduronidase. Ocular hypertension and glaucoma occur in MPS due to GAG acumulation within anterior chamber structures. This can lead to narrowing of the anterior chamber angle, and deposition within trabecular cells may lead to obstruction of outflow. MPS IH Hurler syndrome presents with facial dysmorphism and respiratory disease in early life, and patients may be referred to the ophthalmologist once the diagnosis is already made for detection of associated corneal opacification. The prevalence of ocular complications in patients with MPS was retrospectively reported by Ashworth JL et al.(1). They found in MPS IH patients: in 79% visual acuity of less than 6/12 equivalent in their better eye, in 16% severe corneal opacification, in 16% optic atrophy, in 1% ocular hypertension.

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Discussion:
Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked retinal dystrophy belonging to the family of blinding disorders. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. CHM is caused by mutations in the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1) gene, which encodes a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (1). Complete deletion of the CHM gene causes severe choroideremia. Mura et al. (2) presented results of serial ERGs documenting progression first of rod and then of cone disease.

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

Corneal topography: showing an area of inferior steepening combined with an oblique cylinder >4 diopters and steep keratometric curvature greater than 47 D.
Discussion:
Corneal topography pattern recognition combined with quantitative diagnostic indices is useful for the screening of keratoconus (KC). KC is a noninflammatory progressive corneal disease characterized by localized conical protrusion, apical thinning, irregular astigmatism, and central scarring in the cornea. Keratoconus and other forms of corneal ectasias may be considered as a spectrum of primary corneal ectasia. The prevalence of KC is approximately one per 2,000 in the general population. Lim et al. (1) characterized keratoconus suspect (1) by corneal topography showing an area of central, inferior, or superior steepening combined with any of the following: oblique cylinder >1.5 diopters (D); steep keratometric curvature greater than 47 D, or central corneal thickness less than 500 μm, but without any slit-lamp findings.

Retinal arterial occlusions (CRAO) occurs secondary to an emboli, which may originate from atheromatous plaques in the ascending aorta or carotid arteries, as well as calcified heart valves. Brown et al. (1) reviewed a series of 107 cases with central retinal artery occlusions (CRAO). 26% showed a  macular sparing owing to a patent cilioretinal artery. Patients with patent cilioretinal sparing regained variable degrees of visual acuity. CRAO without cilioretinal sparing rarely regained any useful vision.

Discussion: In general pits of the optic nerve head (OPD) are oval cavities or depressions in the optic disc. Itis a herniation of dysplastic retinal tissue into a collagen rich excavation extending into the subarachnoid space through a defect in the lamina cribrosa.  Pits of the optic nerve can appear as a localized pit-like invagination in the optic disc. They can be congenital or acquired. ODPs can remain clinically asymptomatic in many cases. In about 50% patients with ODPs develop optic disc pit related maculopathy with retinoschisis, atrophy of inner retinal layers, serous macular detachment and significant loss of vision. 1-2

Discussion
Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula (1). Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is increasingly performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was reported (2) that most of the patients who had undergone SelAH had homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects contralateral to the side of the surgery.

Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

Patient: 13 years of age, male, BCVA 0.4 at OD, 0.9 at OS.
General Medical History: new onset, single episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure , MRI showed unclear cerebral tumor.
Ocular Medical History: up to the time of presentation no subjective problems with vision.

Purpose: to show bitemporal and diffuse optic nerve atrophy in suspected central neurocytoma after a new onset, single episode of generalized seizure.
       
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, SD-OCT, Visual Field, cMRI.
Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: regular optic nerve head in OD and OS.
SD-OCT: diffuse and temporally decreased retinal nerve fiber thickness in OD>OS
Visual Field: hemianopsia at OD, complete visual field defect at OS. 
Cranial MRI: Coronal T1-weighted and (B) sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showing  cystic frontobasal and suprasellar lesion with intra- and extraventricular parts with increased T2-signal, no contrast media uptake and no diffusion restriction. Only slight perifocal edema. The maximal extent is 68 x 43 x 58 mm. In summary, this lesion is most likely a central neurocytoma.
Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

General medical history: Systemic therapy with Interferone beta due to multiple sklerosis over several months. Due to ocular problems the systemic therapy with Interferon beta was stopped.
Main complaint: vision deterioration since some weeks (OS<OD) 
Purpose:  to present retinal microinfarcts associated with systemic Interferone beta and improvement of the retina after stopping the systemic Interferone beta-therapy. 
Method: patient undergone examination of fundus photography during and after therapy with systemic Interferone beta.
Findings: 
(1) OS: Retinal microinfarct during therapy with Interferon beta
(2) OS: Regular retina, 4 months after finishing therapy with Interferon beta
Discussion:
Interferons are natural glycoproteins and have antiviral, anti-proliferative and immune regulatory functions. There are several classes including interferon alpha, beta and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are used in the treatment of several diseases including hepatitis C, cancer and immune-mediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Nearly 500 cases of ophthalmological complications related to interferon have been reported (1). The main ophthalmological complication from interferon treatment is essentially a vascular retinopathy  with soft exudates, hemorrhages or retinal ischemia. Hayasaka et al. (2) reported that systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus were clear risk factors for eye disease during therapy with interferons. Frequent exposure to interferon may induce the production of autoantibodies leading to the deposition of immune complexes in the retina or retinal vessels (3).

Discussion
Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula (1). Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is increasingly performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was reported (2) that most of the patients who had undergone SelAH had homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects contralateral to the side of the surgery.

Discussion:  
Island of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule were common postoperatively. A focal collection of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule can mimic a glaucomatous visual field defect. García-Medina JJ  et al. (1) concluded that focal posterior capsular opacification may alter visual field results, and may even simulate the perimetric behaviour of other pathologies such as glaucoma. Consequently, the presence of  a focal posterior capsular opacification should be considered in the interpretation of any automated perimetry in pseudophakic patients.

(2) OCT: no reduction of retinal nerve fiber thickness. 

Discussion: 
Deposition of melanin granules on the corneal endothelium (Krukenberg spindle) is risk factor for glaucoma. Primary pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is a condition usually seen in younger myopic males that is characterized by radial defects of the iris pigment epithelium visible on retroillumination, with liberation and deposition of melanin granules on the corneal endothelium (Krukenberg spindle), on the posterior lens capsule, and in the trabecular meshwork and it is frequently associated with secondary open-angle glaucoma, and also referred to as pigmentary glaucoma, which is believed to be caused by melanin granules that, after being released from the iris pigment epithelium into the aqueous humor, lead to obstruction of the aqueous outflow pathways. The degree of retrocorneal Krukenberg spindle, are graded semiquantitatively by means of the following scale: not present, trace, mild, moderate, and marked. Extensive dispersion of melanin granules, sometimes associated with a marked rise of intraocular pressure, has been described after medical pupillary dilation

Discussion: 
Optic nerve head drusen are calcific deposits buried or at the surface of the optic disc. Nentwich et al. reported (1) that drusen of the optic disc occur in 0.34 to 2.4 % of human individuals. Within histological sections drusen are found six times more often than on funduscopic examination. Diagnostic tools include fundus-autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography and ultrasound. Fundus Autofluorescence  shows inherent autofluorescent properties of optic nerve head drusen. Drusen of the optic nerve head can lead to transient visual impairment, and to profound visual field defects in adulthood. The mechanism of drusen-related field loss is poorly understood. Tso (2) proposed that disc drusen are a consequence of abnormal axonal metabolism leading to the deposition of calcium crystals in mitochondria and disruption of axons with further accumulation of calcified cellular contents.

Discussion:
Jonas et al (1) described morphological optic nerve head variables to classify glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Thus, glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy is classified by morphologic changes in the intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer: size and shape of the optic disc; size, shape and pallor of the neuroretinal rim; size of the optic cup in relation to the area of the disc; configuration and depth of the optic cup; cup-to-disc diameter ratio and cup-to-disc area ratio; presence and location of splinter-shaped haemorrhages; occurrence, size, configuration and location of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy; diffuse and/or focal decrease of the diameter of the retinal arterioles; and visibility of the retinal nerve fibre layer. Assessment of these variables is useful for the detection of glaucomatous optic nerve damage, and to differentiate various types of optic nerve atrophy. He suggested, that highest diagnostic power had the vertical cup-to-disc diameter ratio corrected for its dependence on the optic disc size, total neuroretinal rim area, rim-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size, and cup-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size. Oliveira C et al (2) using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope found a mean optic disc size in white subjects of 1.97+-0.6 mm².

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Mesodermal abnormalities of the anterior segment include Axenfeld‘s anomaly and Rieger‘s anomaly. Axenfeld's anomaly shows a posterior embryotoxon. Posterior embryotoxon is a prominent Schwalbe's line that may be a partial or complete bilateral ring and is usually visible on gross external examination. It is an indication of either Axenfeld's anomaly/syndrome or Rieger's anomaly/syndrome, both of which are anterior chamber syndromes that put patients at risk for glaucoma.

Discussion:
Perfluorodecalin is a perfluorocarbon liquid used intraoperatively in retinal detachment repair. The clarity of perfluorocarbon liquids, with a refractive index is close to that of water. It is usually removed at the end of the procedure. However, residual amounts may be retained. Peyman et al. (1) reported, that perfluorocarbon liquids have been used to facilitate surgery in a wide variety of conditions, including proliferative vitreoretinopathy, giant retinal tears, drainage of suprachoroidal hemorrhages, diabetic traction, retinal detachments with a rhegmatogenous component, dislocated crystalline or intraocular lenses, and retinal detachment associated with choroidal coloboma. All perfluorocarbon liquids when used as tamponading agents can compress and disorganize the retina. This ""toxicity"" is a physical effect rather than chemical toxicity and depends upon the amount of perfluorocarbon liquid injected. Perfluorocarbon liquids are not tolerated in the anterior chamber, causing corneal edema within 2-3 days at the site of contact.

Major complaints: deterioration of BCVA at OD since two months.
Ocular medical history: beginning cataract.
General medical history: arterial hypertension, history of cardiac infarction.

Purpose: To describe the morphologic changes of a retinal macroaneurysm.

Methods: 
Patient underwent ophthalmoscopy, FFA, and Heidelberg spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT)

Findings: 
Ophthalmoscopy: subretinal hemorrhage, retinal exudate
FFA: lack of early hyperfluorescence, focal hypofluorescence due to retinal hemorrhage.
OCT: superficial retinal hemorrhage, intraretinal lipids, and minor intraretinal edema prominently involving the outer retinal layers.

Discussion: 
Arterial macroaneurysms comprise a distinct retinal vascular disorder. Most commonly seen in elderly females, the disorder is often associated with underlying hypertension and systemic arteriosclerotic disease. The natural history is one of gradual and spontaneous involution with good visual prognosis in the majority of cases. Complications of retinal or vitreous hemorrhage and macular edema, with resultant loss of vision, can occur. Treatment is recommended when there is visual loss. Photocoagulation treatment may be applied directly to the macroaneurysm, indirectly by surrounding the macroaneurysm, or as a combination of these two methods. It remains unclear whether indirect treatment is superior to direct treatment (1).

Patient: 63 years of age, male, BCVA 0.5.
General Medical History: diabetes, arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: loss of visual acuity at OS.
Purpose: to present a retinal lesion, suggesting retinal macroaneurysma by FFA.

Discussion:
Retinal arterial macroaneurysm (RAMA) is an acquired vessel dilation of branches of the central retinal artery. Risk factors include female gender, age over 60 years and arterial hypertension. The typical course of a RAMA starts with a growing phase, followed by gradual spontaneous fibrosis and/or thrombosis and finally involution without any therapy. In exudative RAMA, laser photocoagulation is an established therapy to induce thrombosis and promote reabsorption of exudates. Antiangiogenic intravitreal therapy has proven effective to close the RAMA and improve vision. Koinzer et al (1) examined N=49 charts of patients with RAMA and compared the long-term visual acuity (VA) in three groups according to treatment:  untreated, photocoagulation and vitrectomy. He found that VA remained unchanged in the observed and the laser groups after 3 years.

Ocular medical history:  empty.    
General medical history: Systemic therapy with Interferone beta due to multiple sklerosis over several months. Due to ocular problems the systemic therapy with Interferon beta was stopped.
Main complaint: vision deterioration since some weeks (OS<OD) 
Purpose:  to present retinal microinfarcts associated with systemic Interferone beta and improvement of the retina after stopping the systemic Interferone beta-therapy. 
Method: patient undergone examination of fundus photography during and after therapy with systemic Interferone beta.
Findings: 
(1) OS: Retinal microinfarct during therapy with Interferon beta
(2) OS: Regular retina, 4 months after finishing therapy with Interferon beta
Discussion:
Interferons are natural glycoproteins and have antiviral, anti-proliferative and immune regulatory functions. There are several classes including interferon alpha, beta and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are used in the treatment of several diseases including hepatitis C, cancer and immune-mediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Nearly 500 cases of ophthalmological complications related to interferon have been reported (1). The main ophthalmological complication from interferon treatment is essentially a vascular retinopathy  with soft exudates, hemorrhages or retinal ischemia. Hayasaka et al. (2) reported that systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus were clear risk factors for eye disease during therapy with interferons. Frequent exposure to interferon may induce the production of autoantibodies leading to the deposition of immune complexes in the retina or retinal vessels (3).

Discussion:
It was shown by Liu et al. (1) that progression and regression of DR were strongly associated with blood pressure and glycemic exposure.  In a huge study they investigated the progression and regression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the effects of population risk factors on the rates of transition across retinopathy stages. From 1990 to 2011   4,758 diabetic patients who were diagnosed at 35 years of age or older were observed. They found a consistent risk effect of HbA1c on the progression  from no retinopathy to mild background DR a hazard ratio per SD of HbA1c  of 1.42, from mild BDR to observable BDR a hazard ratio of 1.32, and from observable BDR to severe nonproliferative/proliferative DR a hazard ratio of 2.23. Similarly, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure increased the risk for the transition from the asymptomatic phase to mild BDR  with a hazard ratio of 1.20 and from the mild BDR to observable BDR with a hazard ratio of 1.87, respectively. Regression from mild BDR to no DR was associated with lower SBP and lower HbA1c .

Discussion:
Spontaneous hyphema refers to a nontraumatic hemorrhage in the anterior chamber and may result from such conditions as rubeosis iridis, intraocular neoplasms, blood dyscrasias, severe iritis, fibrovascular membranes in the retrolental or zonular area, and vascular anomalies of the iris. Terry et al. (1) presented  a case with a spontaneous hyphema occurring as a result of iris neovascularization in a patient who suffered from occlusion of the central retinal vein.

Patient: 34 years of age, female, BCVA  1.0 at OD , 1.0 at OS, IOP 17/15 mmHg.
General Medical History: empty. 
Ocular Medical History: unclear visual field defect at OD. 
Main Complaint: vision decline at OD.
Purpose: to present pseudo-glaucomatous visual field defect in pit of optic nerve head.
Methods: colour photography posterior pole, OCT Triton, visual field. 
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: myopic configuration, herniation of retinal tissue  with focal rim excavation at 7h.
Visual field: visual field defect temporal superior.
OCT Triton, macula: regular macula,  deep rim excavation at  8h.  
OCT Triton, retinal nerve layer: focal thinning  from  6-9h
Discussion: In general pits of the optic nerve head (OPD) are oval cavities or depressions in the optic disc. Itis a herniation of dysplastic retinal tissue into a collagen rich excavation extending into the subarachnoid space through a defect in the lamina cribrosa.  Pits of the optic nerve can appear as a localized pit-like invagination in the optic disc. They can be congenital or acquired. ODPs can remain clinically asymptomatic in many cases. In about 50% patients with ODPs develop optic disc pit related maculopathy with retinoschisis, atrophy of inner retinal layers, serous macular detachment and significant loss of vision. 1-2

Ocular medical history: at OS central scotoma since two weeks.
General medical history: Bone marrow biopsy showing chronic myelogenous leukemia. The laboratory evaluation depicting white blood cell count of 620.000. Chemotherapy was initiated.
Methods: Color photography, SD-OCT (HE, Germany).
Findings:
(1) Fundoscopic examination of OS: optic disc edema, retinal venous tortuousity and dilatation, retinal blot and flame-shaped hemorrhages, Roth spots.
(2) SD-OCT of optic nerve head, OS: optic disc edema.
(3) SD-OCT of macula: central and peripheral infiltrates. 
Discussion:
Retinopathy in Chronic Myeloic Leukemia („Fundus leucaemicus“) is often associated with reduction of visual acuity. The ocular manifestations are unspecific, but characteristic for severe systemic diseases. Color fundus photograph show marked venous dilatation and tortuosity, cotton wool spots, and multiple retinal, preretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots. Large whitish retinal masses present temporally with satellite lesions at the posterior border are suggestive of retinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is helpful for quantification of the pathological retinal changes. Peripheral blood counts and differential haemograms are seminal for the diagnosis of CML.

Main complaint: Decrease of visual acuity (OS>OD).
Ocular medical history: at OS central scotoma since two weeks.
General medical history: Bone marrow biopsy showing chronic myelogenous leukemia. The laboratory evaluation depicting white blood cell count of 620.000. Chemotherapy was initiated.
Methods: Color photography, SD-OCT (HE, Germany).
Findings:
(1) Fundoscopic examination of OS: optic disc edema, retinal venous tortuousity and dilatation, retinal blot and flame-shaped hemorrhages, Roth spots.
(2) SD-OCT of optic nerve head, OS: optic disc edema.
(3) SD-OCT of macula: central and peripheral infiltrates. 
Discussion:
Retinopathy in Chronic Myeloic Leukemia („Fundus leucaemicus“) is often associated with reduction of visual acuity. The ocular manifestations are unspecific, but characteristic for severe systemic diseases. Color fundus photograph show marked venous dilatation and tortuosity, cotton wool spots, and multiple retinal, preretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots. Large whitish retinal masses present temporally with satellite lesions at the posterior border are suggestive of retinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is helpful for quantification of the pathological retinal changes. Peripheral blood counts and differential haemograms are seminal for the diagnosis of CML. First line therapy for CML is the application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Glivec). Ophthalmological adverse effects of this therapy, such as periorbital edema, are possible (1,2) .

Patient: 68 years of age, female, BCVA 1.0 at OD, 0.8 at OS, IOP 12/9 mmHg.
Ocular Medical History: Unilateral increased intraocular pressure in OS since 2013, filtrating surgery in OS in 2014.
General Medical History: arterial hypertension.
Purpose: to present optic pit in glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, Optical Coherence Tomography, Visual Field.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: thinned rim and optic disc pit at the inferotemporal periphery of the optic disc. 
Optical Coherence Tomography at 5 o’clock: yellow line indicates the scanned optical coherence tomography (OCT) lines, B-scan image illustrates the no hyporeflective space indicating an optic disc pit.

Optical Coherence Tomography at 8 o‘clock: yellow line indicates the scanned optical coherence tomography (OCT) lines, B-scan image shows no hyporeflective space indicating an optic disc pit. 
OCT Circular Scan: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness RNFL at the inferotemporal sector.
Visual Field: parafoveal scotoma in the superior hemifield corresponding to the decreased RNFL thickness at the inferotemporal sector. 
Discussion: 
Choi et al. (1) reported that optic disc pits had a diverse structure according to the alteration of the lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue. Optic disc pit is often associated with a corresponding scotoma. Choi et al. (1) suggested, that a compliant lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue may become susceptible to the damaging effects of increased IOP values. The ongoing insult to the optic nerve may then influence the lamina cribrosa tissue or prelaminar tissue, exhibiting the appearance of alteration in the lamina cribrosa or or prelaminar tissue. Subsequently, the axons passing through the altered lamina cribrosa and or prelaminar tissue are likely to be damaged by loss of structural support, loss of nutrient supply from laminar capillaries, or loss of metabolic support from astrocytes.

Such abnormalities include changes in the optic disc area, cup area, and neuroretinal rim volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Assessment of the optic disc size is an essential component. Eyes with smaller discs might induce higher risks for developing and processing glaucomatous damage due to fewer optic nerve fibers and a smaller anatomic reserve capacity.

Patient: 72 years of age, female, BCVA perception of light at OD, 0.6 at OS.
Ocular Medical History: marked loss of vision in one eye and signs of involvement in other eye. C-reactive protein evaluation was 69 mg/l. Patient showing a high index of suspicion of giant cell arteritis was immediately started on systemic corticosteroid therapy and had temporal artery biopsy performed. Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis was confirmed on temporal artery biopsy. 
General medical history: headache.
Purpose: to present anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in both eyes in giant cell arteritis.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Segment OD: papilloedema, diffuse swelling, blurred border, no hemorrhage around the disc rim.
Colour Photography Posterior Segment OS: sectoral swelling and blurred border at 6h, no hemorrhage around the disc rim.
OCT OD: diffused optic disc swelling with almost total disappearance of the physiological cup, ONH fiber crowding. 
OCT OS: sectorial peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer edema at 6h. 

Discussion:
Arteritis temporalis shows a variable course of the disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss. Hayeh et al. (1) reported, that patients with giant cell arteritis presented a variety of ocular symptoms : visual loss of varying severity in 98%, amaurosis fugax in 31%, diplopia in 6%, and eye pain in 8%. Because giant cell arteritis is a potentially blinding disease and its early diagnosis is the key to preventing blindness, it is important to recognize its various ocular manifestations. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ infarction (2).

Discussion:
Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked retinal dystrophy belonging to the family of blinding disorders. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. CHM is caused by mutations in the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1) gene, which encodes a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (1). Complete deletion of the CHM gene causes severe choroideremia. Mura et al. (2) presented results of serial ERGs documenting progression first of rod and then of cone disease.

Patient: 58 years of age, male, BCVA 0.8 at OD, 0.7 at OS, IOP 16/14 mmHg.
Ocular Medical History: therapy with topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and prostaglandin analogs.
General Medical History: arterial hypertension.
Main Complaint: visual field defects at OS.
Purpose: to present glaucomatous optic nerve degeneration in a patient with small optic discs. 

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT-Spectralis, Visual Field, HRT.

Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: small optic discs with parapapillary atrophy,  no visible cupping. 
OCT: thinned  retinal nerve fiber layer with  43 µm at OD, 49 µm at OS.
Visual Field: visual field defects (OS>OD) with MD 5.0dB at OD, MD 6.5dB at OS.
HRT: small disc areas with  1.2 mm² at OD, 1.4mm² at OS, regular HRT-parameters.

Discussion:
Disc areas lower or equal 1.5 mm2 were defined as small discs. The detection of glaucoma focusses on the evaluation of morphometric changes in the optic nerve. Such abnormalities include changes in the optic disc area, cup area, and neuroretinal rim volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Assessment of the optic disc size is an essential component. Eyes with smaller discs might induce higher risks for developing and processing glaucomatous damage due to fewer optic nerve fibers and a smaller anatomic reserve capacity. Optic nerve fiber count correlates with optic disc area. (1)

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

Discussion:
Axenfeld nerve loop has a topographic distribution similar to anterior episcleral nerve sheath tumors. Chang et al. reported (1), that the nerve loop of Axenfeld is an anastomotic interconnection of the long ciliary nerve that occasionally turns to enter the sclera before turning back again to continue anteriorly to the ciliary body. The loops occur in the area 2 to 4 mm posterior to the limbus.

Discussion:
Before establishing the RP diagnosis, it was essential to rule out other possible etiologies such as trauma, infection, inflammation, and cancer. Our case did not presented traumatic history of the head or eye. Our workup ruled out infectious diseases, such as Lyme disease, bartonellosis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, and viral infections. Inflammatory diseases were ruled out. Farrell (1) examined a total of 272 cases of retinitis pigmentosa and 167 cases of cone-rod dystrophy. He found that the percentage of familial and nonfamilial cases was the same for the bilateral and unilateral forms of the disease. In his series, unilateral retinitis pigmentosa makes up approximately 5% of the total population of retinitis pigmentosa. He said, that in the familial forms of unilateral retinitis pigmentosa the most common inheritance pattern was autosomal dominant and all affected relatives had bilateral disease.
The genetic mechanisms which account for asymmetric disorders are not currently understood. It may be a different unidentified mutation at a single loci or it is possible that nonlinked mutations in multiple loci account for this unusual disorder. Marsiglia  et al. (2) proposed 2 genetic mechanisms that could explain the unusual unilateral presentation of RP: mosaicism and somatic mutations. Both mechanisms may cause asymmetric and partial involvement of a genetic disease throughout the body.

Patient: 52 years of age, female, BCVA 0.1 at OD, 1.0 at OS, IOP 11mmHg/14 mmHg.
Ocular Medical History: no trauma, infection, or inflammation.
General Medical History: empty, no history of cancer. 
Main Complaint: decreased vision and concentric reduced visual field at OD.
Methods: Colour Image, ERG, OCT.
Findings:
Colour Image: at OD atrophy of optic nerve head, strong pigment proliferation in retinal periphery; at OS regular optic nerve head, and regular retinal appearance.
ERG: at OD reduced scotopic and photopic ERG; at OS regular ERG.
OCT: at OD cystoid macular edema, and thinning of photoreceptor layer; at OS regular findings.

Discussion:
Before establishing the RP diagnosis, it was essential to rule out other possible etiologies such as trauma, infection, inflammation, and cancer. Our case did not presented traumatic history of the head or eye. Our workup ruled out infectious diseases, such as Lyme disease, bartonellosis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, and viral infections. Inflammatory diseases were ruled out. Farrell (1) examined a total of 272 cases of retinitis pigmentosa and 167 cases of cone-rod dystrophy. He found that the percentage of familial and nonfamilial cases was the same for the bilateral and unilateral forms of the disease. In his series, unilateral retinitis pigmentosa makes up approximately 5% of the total population of retinitis pigmentosa. He said, that in the familial forms of unilateral retinitis pigmentosa the most common inheritance pattern was autosomal dominant and all affected relatives had bilateral disease.
The genetic mechanisms which account for asymmetric disorders are not currently understood. It may be a different unidentified mutation at a single loci or it is possible that nonlinked mutations in multiple loci account for this unusual disorder. Marsiglia  et al. (2) proposed 2 genetic mechanisms that could explain the unusual unilateral presentation of RP: mosaicism and somatic mutations. Both mechanisms may cause asymmetric and partial involvement of a genetic disease throughout the body.

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Discussion: 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause after diabetic retinopathy of vision loss due to retinal vascular disease. Branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is about 3-6 times more common than central vein occlusion (CRVO). Ho et al. (1) reported, that pooled data showed prevalence rates of about 0.52% for any RVO, 0.44% for BRVO, and 0.08% for CRVO. BRVO is caused by a combination of vein compression at arteriovenous crossings, degenerative changes within venous walls, and hypercoagulability. 34% of nonischemic retinal vein occlusion converted to the ischemic type. Kokolaki et al. (2) showed, that collateral vessels developed in 60% of patients 6±3 months after diagnosis.

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

Discussion: 
Optic nerve head drusen are calcific deposits buried or at the surface of the optic disc. Nentwich et al. reported (1) that drusen of the optic disc occur in 0.34 to 2.4 % of human individuals. Within histological sections drusen are found six times more often than on funduscopic examination. Diagnostic tools include fundus-autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography and ultrasound. Fundus Autofluorescence  shows inherent autofluorescent properties of optic nerve head drusen. Drusen of the optic nerve head can lead to transient visual impairment, and to profound visual field defects in adulthood. The mechanism of drusen-related field loss is poorly understood. Tso (2) proposed that disc drusen are a consequence of abnormal axonal metabolism leading to the deposition of calcium crystals in mitochondria and disruption of axons with further accumulation of calcified cellular contents.

Such abnormalities include changes in the optic disc area, cup area, and neuroretinal rim volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Assessment of the optic disc size is an essential component. Eyes with smaller discs might induce higher risks for developing and processing glaucomatous damage due to fewer optic nerve fibers and a smaller anatomic reserve capacity. Optic nerve fiber count correlates with optic disc area. (1)

https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/photo.jsf?node=5831&locale=en,Tonic Pupil,"Top: This 29-year-old man reported that his right pupil had been dilated for six weeks.  On direct light stimulation, the right pupil showed minimal reaction while that on the left reacted normally.  Slit lamp examination revealed that the dysfunction of the iris sphincter muscle in the right eye was sectoral, with some segments retaining contractile ability and others showing complete paralysis.  Eyelids and ocular motility were normal.
Bottom: Following instillation of weak-strength (0.125%) pilocarpine into both eyes, the right pupil constricts to the point where it is smaller than the left pupil.  The demonstration of this phenomenon, termed denervation supersensitivity, helps to confirm the diagnosis of tonic pupil.

Unilateral or bilateral tonic pupils reflect damage to post-ganglionic parasympathetic fibers, either at the level of the ciliary ganglion or along the course of the short ciliary nerves.

Bottom:In relative darkness, the anisocoria is markedly diminished.

Anisocoria that is more pronounced in bright light than in dim light suggests that the larger pupil is the abnormal one and that the clinical signs reflect parasympathetic dysfunction.  Note, however, that there are a number of exceptions to this general rule.

https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/photo.jsf?node=5833&locale=en,Tonic Pupil,"Top:The anisocoria in this patient is due to a tonic pupil in the right eye, based on the concurrence of sectoral palsy of the iris sphincter and denervation supersensitivity to weak-strength miotics.
Bottom: When the patient fixates on a near target, the dilated right pupil constricts slowly and progressively until it becomes slightly smaller than the simultaneously constricted left pupil.  This is an example of light-near dissociation.  In patients with unilateral or bilateral tonic pupils, light-near dissociation is due to aberrant reinnervation of the paretic iris sphincter muscle by fibers that originally innervated the ciliary muscle.

Discussion
Fuchs' corneal dystrophy - a dominantly inherited disorder -  is a slowly progressive, bilateral corneal dystrophy that affects corneal endothelial cells. 
Cataract surgery is a risk factor for corneal endothelial cell loss. Corneal endothelial cell loss, a major complication that sometimes occurs after cataract surgery, can lead to corneal edema and decompensation if cell density falls to 500 cells/mm2 or below. Yamazoe et al (1) reported that the mean rate of endothelial cell loss is about 12% ± 23%.  Seitzman  et al (2) reported a series of patients with Fuchs' dystrophy (136 eyes) undergoing cataract surgery. The average preoperative corneal thickness ranged from 482 to 674 µm. 37% had preoperative corneal thickness of 600 µm or thicker. Of eyes with preoperative pachymetry measurements of 600 µm or thicker, 10% progressed to penetrating keratoplasty. Patients with a preoperative corneal thickness of >640 μm had a 22.2% rate of requiring a corneal transplant. Their data suggest that current cataract removal techniques allow for excellent visual rehabilitation in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy who have a preoperative corneal thickness lower than 600 µm. They recommend a concurrent penetrating keratoplasty with cataract surgery in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy and a corneal thickness of >640 μm.

Patient: 50 years of age, female, BCVA 0.4 at OD, 0.5 at OS; IOP 15/15 mmHg
General Medical History: biopsy confirmed diagnosis of  tubulointerstitial nephritis, arterial hypertension; therapy with steroids from 02/2013 to 10/2013, in 11/2013 vision reduction, redness, and photophobia.
Ocular Medical History: Approximately 8 months of tubulointerstitial nephritis symptoms red, photophobic eyes of 2 weeks duration, OD>OS. Uveitis responded well to topical steroid and cycloplegic treatment. Follow-up examinations showed  a gradual decrease in the inflammation, with no ocular complications.
Main Complaint: vision reduction, redness, and photophobia. 
Findings:
Colour photography cornea (OD): mildly injected conjunctivae bilateral, small, round keratic precipitates in nongranulomatous anterior-segment inflammation.

Discussion: Uveitis in association with tubulointerstitial nephritis is a distinct clinical entity known as tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome. It is considered to be a rare disease and thus unfortunately is still unfamiliar to most ophthalmologists. The onset of uveitis most commonly follows the onset of the interstitial nephritis, but may also occur before or concurrently. The uveitis is usually bilateral, nongranulomatous, limited to the anterior segment. TINU generally responds well to topical or oral anti-inflammatory treatment. Johnson et al. (1) suggested, that TINU syndrome as an under-recognized disorder may account for some cases of uveitis otherwise characterized as 'idiopathic."" The uveitis may be the presenting sign in up to 36% of cases of TINU syndrome. Prompt detection through referral or testing will allow speedy diagnosis and appropriate treatment for both the uveitis and the tubulointerstitial nephritis. The cause of the disease is still unknown. A hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, especially an infection is thought to trigger the disease. Mackensen  et al. (2) showed  advances in diagnostics. Beta-2 microglobulin (Ub2MG) analysis in urine and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is helpful to diagnose TINU cases. A high association of HLA-DRB1*01 has been shown with TINU.

Findings:
Colour Image: The anterior pyramidal opacity consisted of hyperplastic lens epithelium, surrounded by a collagenous matrix.
Discussion:
Pyramidal anterior polar cataracts consist of hyperplastic lens epithelium in a collagenous matrix. They are present at birth and may represent a variant of anterior polar lens opacities. Anterior polar cataracts may be unilateral or, if bilateral, they may be either symmetric or asymmetric. Patients with pyramidal cataracts are likely to develop amblyopia. All infants and young children with anterior polar opacities showing this configuration should be followed for cataract progression and amblyopia.
It was reported (1, 2) that, over one-third of the patients with congenital anterior polar cataracts were found to have strabismus, refractive anisometropia, or some form of amblyopia. These findings suggest a less benign prognosis for congenital anterior polar cataracts.

Corneal topography pattern recognition combined with quantitative diagnostic indices is useful for the screening of keratoconus (KC). KC is a noninflammatory progressive corneal disease characterized by localized conical protrusion, apical thinning, irregular astigmatism, and central scarring in the cornea. Keratoconus and other forms of corneal ectasias may be considered as a spectrum of primary corneal ectasia. The prevalence of KC is approximately one per 2,000 in the general population. Lim et al.

The eyes are seen to be more exotropic or less esotropic in upgaze. In downgaze, the eyes are less exotropic or more esotropic. V-patterns may or may not be associated with oblique muscle overaction. If overaction is present, it will be seen both on duction testing in the direction of the primary action of the oblique muscle in question and also as a hypertropia in horizontal gaze. In this patient, the V-pattern is felt to be secondary to inferior oblique muscle overaction, which is acting primarily as an abductor in upgaze, causing the eyes to diverge more than in downgaze.
Primary gaze: This young patient is esotropic in primary gaze. She is fixing with her right eye and the left eye is clearly turned in towards the nose. The light reflexes are not symmetrical. Down-gaze: The esotropia is much greater than in down-gaze than up-gaze, creating the ""point"" of the V-pattern even though the patient looks orthophoric. Upgaze: The V-pattern is felt to be secondary to inferior oblique muscle overaction, which is acting primarily as an abductor in upgaze, causing the eyes to diverge more in upgaze than in downgaze. Thus, this patient looks exotropic in this photograph. Right and left gaze: V-patterns may or may not be associated with oblique muscle overaction Here the right and left inferior oblique muscle show a 3+ overaction/hypertropia in right/left gaze.

Ocular medical history:  empty.    
General medical history: Systemic therapy with Interferone beta due to multiple sklerosis over several months. Due to ocular problems the systemic therapy with Interferon beta was stopped.
Main complaint: vision deterioration since some weeks (OS<OD) 
Purpose:  to present retinal microinfarcts associated with systemic Interferone beta and improvement of the retina after stopping the systemic Interferone beta-therapy. 
Method: patient undergone examination of fundus photography during and after therapy with systemic Interferone beta.
Findings: 
(1) OS: Retinal microinfarct during therapy with Interferon beta
(2) OS: Regular retina, 4 months after finishing therapy with Interferon beta
Discussion:
Interferons are natural glycoproteins and have antiviral, anti-proliferative and immune regulatory functions. There are several classes including interferon alpha, beta and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are used in the treatment of several diseases including hepatitis C, cancer and immune-mediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Nearly 500 cases of ophthalmological complications related to interferon have been reported (1). The main ophthalmological complication from interferon treatment is essentially a vascular retinopathy  with soft exudates, hemorrhages or retinal ischemia. Hayasaka et al. (2) reported that systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus were clear risk factors for eye disease during therapy with interferons. Frequent exposure to interferon may induce the production of autoantibodies leading to the deposition of immune complexes in the retina or retinal vessels (3).

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

General Medical History: new onset, single episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure , MRI showed unclear cerebral tumor.
Ocular Medical History: up to the time of presentation no subjective problems with vision.

Purpose: to show bitemporal and diffuse optic nerve atrophy in suspected central neurocytoma after a new onset, single episode of generalized seizure.
       
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, SD-OCT, Visual Field, cMRI.
Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: regular optic nerve head in OD and OS.
SD-OCT: diffuse and temporally decreased retinal nerve fiber thickness in OD>OS
Visual Field: hemianopsia at OD, complete visual field defect at OS. 
Cranial MRI: Coronal T1-weighted and (B) sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showing  cystic frontobasal and suprasellar lesion with intra- and extraventricular parts with increased T2-signal, no contrast media uptake and no diffusion restriction. Only slight perifocal edema. The maximal extent is 68 x 43 x 58 mm. In summary, this lesion is most likely a central neurocytoma.
Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, Red Free Photography Posterior Pole, SD-OCT, Visual Field. 

Findings:

Discussion: 
Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy characterized by retinal ganglion cells (RGC) loss and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) injury. Medeiros FA et al. (1) showed, that glaucomatous eyes had an average retinal ganglion cells loss of 28%, ranging from 6% to 57%, at the time of the earliest visual field defect on standard automated perimetry (SAP) visual fields. Glaucomatous eyes with the earliest detectable visual field loss on automated perimetry may already show substantial loss of retinal ganglion cells.

SD-OCT, in March 2013: showing a decreased retinal nerve fiber layer at OS, and no edema of optic nerve head.
Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

Such abnormalities include changes in the optic disc area, cup area, and neuroretinal rim volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Assessment of the optic disc size is an essential component. Eyes with smaller discs might induce higher risks for developing and processing glaucomatous damage due to fewer optic nerve fibers and a smaller anatomic reserve capacity.

Discussion: In general pits of the optic nerve head (OPD) are oval cavities or depressions in the optic disc. Itis a herniation of dysplastic retinal tissue into a collagen rich excavation extending into the subarachnoid space through a defect in the lamina cribrosa.  Pits of the optic nerve can appear as a localized pit-like invagination in the optic disc. They can be congenital or acquired. ODPs can remain clinically asymptomatic in many cases. In about 50% patients with ODPs develop optic disc pit related maculopathy with retinoschisis, atrophy of inner retinal layers, serous macular detachment and significant loss of vision. 1-2

Discussion:  Work-related injuries can cause significant morbidity in a young population of patients. Occupational injuries are common.

The lifetime prevalence of work-related eye injuries among US workers is 4.4% (1). Bauza et al. (2) analyzed the clinical characteristics of a total of 183 eyes with work-related open globe injuries. He found that the majority of injuries occurred in men (96.7%), and the most common cause was nail gun use (47.0%). Intraocular foreign bodies were found in 21%. Presenting visual acuity (VA) was worse than 20/200 in 66% and no light perception in 6%. Final visual acuity worse than 20/200 occurred in 37%. Significant prognostic factors for a final visual acuity of no light perception were rupture injury, and initial visual acuity of no light perception.

https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/photo.jsf?node=7848&locale=en,"Wound Dehiscence After ECCE, Loose Sutures in Peripheral Corneo-scleral Incision Without Conjunctival Flap","The patient had an extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE). 5 days postoperatively he was noted to have a wound dehiscence secondary to loose sutures. Seidel test was negative. 
The applied type of corneoscleral incision usually leads to loosening of the sutures because the suture is not covered by conjunctival tissue like it would be with a fornix-based flap. The soft conjunctiva gives in and the suture loosenes. Slight pressure on the cornea would make the Seidel-test positive. The sutures hold well on Bowman's membrane but they loosen on the scleral side. Alternative options would  have been  a truly corneal incision or a fornix- or limbus-based conjunctival flap over a sclerocorneal incision.
Advice for present situation: Woundrevision , 2-3 situation sutures, fornix-based conjunctival flap; cleaning of wound (presumably there is a vitreous strand which reaches from the peaked pupil to the periphery at 11 o'clock with damaged iris); 5 10-0-Nylon sutures  broad in sclera and cornea and then 2 traction sutures to cover the wound with conjunctival flap.",#Optho::Lens::PostoperativeCasesandSurgicalProcedures,https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/atlasimg/1248913797520_low.jpg,"<img src=""7848.jpg"">"
