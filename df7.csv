https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/photo.jsf?node=4014&locale=en,leber's hereditary optic neuropathy,"The right optic disc can be viewed by considering the two halves of the disc separately.  The temporal half is moderately pale and has a discrete margin.  Corresponding nerve fiber layer reflexes are absent.  By contrast, the nasal half of the disc has an *angry* appearance, with disc hyperemia and mild dilation of the large retinal vessels.  The peripapillary nerve fiber layer exhibits loss of translucency and a whitish haze, partially obscuring the nasal disc margins.  Note the telangiectatic vessels just off the disc at 3:00 and 3:30.","#Optho::OpticNerve::OpticNeuropathies::HereditaryOpticNeuropathy::Leber'sHereditaryOpticNeuropathy::Case,LeberHereditaryOpticNeuropathy","<img src=""4014.jpg"">","Red-free illumination makes obvious the marked opacification of the nerve fiber layer superiorly, nasally, and inferiorly.  Note the complete absence of visible nerve fiber layer reflexes in a discrete temporal sector, corresponding to the atrophic portion of the disc. Loss of the papillomacular fibers correlates with the severe degree of central visual loss.","<img src=""4015.jpg"">","This view of the left disc shows marked hyperemia and striking retinal arteriolar dilation. Telangiectatic vessels are present at 3:00 and 5:00.
Note the coarsening and opacification of the nerve fiber layer, particularly inferiorly.
Visual loss predated these photos by six months OD and by one month OS. Thus, the right disc has entered the early atrophic stage while the left disc exemplifies the acute stage of LHON.  Visual acuity is 20/400 OD and 20/30 OS.
","<img src=""4016.jpg"">","The left disc shows a similar picture.  However, because the left eye was involved first and thus is at a somewhat later stage, the various clinical signs- hyperemia, arteriolar dilation and opacification of the nerve fiber layer-  have started to resolve.","<img src=""4017.jpg"">","This is the classic appearance of the Leber's disc in the early symptomatic stage, when visual loss is just beginning. The disc is intensely hyperemic. Both the retinal veins and the arteries are dilated, creating the impression of a plethora of vascular trunks on the disc.  In the peripapillary zone, moderate vascular tortuosity is present. Note the whitish opacification of the nerve fiber layer surrounding all but the temporal side of the disc.","<img src=""4018.jpg"">","In this 21-year-old man with LHON, there is striking contrast between findings on the temporal and nasal halves of the right optic disc.  Temporally, the disc is ""quiet"", moderately pale, and discrete.  The nasal side exhibits hyperemia, retinal arteriolar dilation, and contiguous whitening and opacification of the nerve fiber layer. Note that nerve fiber reflexes are absent within a broad temporal sector.","<img src=""4020.jpg"">","The left disc shows the same temporal-nasal dichotomy.  A wedge of temporal pallor is associated with sectoral loss of nerve fiber layer reflexes. On the nasal side, hyperemia, arteriolar dilation, and blurring of the disc margins are seen.  The adjacent nerve fiber layer appears whitened and partially opacified.
Visual acuity is 20/400 OU with bilateral cecocentral scotomas.","<img src=""4026.jpg"">"
