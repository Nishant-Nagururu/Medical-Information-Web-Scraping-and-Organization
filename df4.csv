Patient: 67 years of age, BVCA 0.3 at OD, 0.6 at OS, IOP 16/18 mmHg. 
General Medical History: arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: decreased vision in OD.
Main Complaint: unclear vision loss.
Purpose: to present peripherial ischemic retinopathy in mainly regular central fundus.
Methods: Colour Photogaphy Posterior Segment, Optical Coherence Tomography, Fundus Fluorescein Angiography.  
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: nonperfused segment in superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, few intraretinal hemorrhages, no nerve fiber layer infarcts, no optic disc edema.
Fluorescein angiography (FA): nonperfused segment of superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, peripherial retinal neovascularisation, peripheral capillary nonperfusion with more than 10 disc diameters of retinal capillary nonperfusion.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT): decrease in foveal thickness, impaired inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, no macular swelling, no macular edema.
Discussion: 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause after diabetic retinopathy of vision loss due to retinal vascular disease. Branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is about 3-6 times more common than central vein occlusion (CRVO). Ho et al. (1) reported, that pooled data showed prevalence rates of about 0.52% for any RVO, 0.44% for BRVO, and 0.08% for CRVO. BRVO is caused by a combination of vein compression at arteriovenous crossings, degenerative changes within venous walls, and hypercoagulability. 34% of nonischemic retinal vein occlusion converted to the ischemic type. Kokolaki et al. (2) showed, that collateral vessels developed in 60% of patients 6±3 months after diagnosis.

Discussion: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, resulting in structural damage to the optic nerve head (ONH) and inner retina.  Approximately half of these retinal ganglion cells are located within 4.5 mm of the center of the fovea. The superficial capillaries mainly nourish the ganglion cell layer. Penteado RC (1) evaluated  in 185 eyes the association between macula vascular density assessed by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and central visual field (VF) threshold sensitivities in healthy, glaucoma suspect, and glaucoma patients.  He found  that  severe glaucoma subjects had significantly lower macula vessel density values compared with early glaucoma or healthy eyes.  They reported  that glaucoma eyes generally had sparser macula capillary networks compared with healthy eyes, glaucoma suspects, or mild glaucoma eyes. They documented an average macula vessel density  for healthy eyes  of 52.5%±3.7%, and for moderate/severe glaucoma patients  of 45.2%±3.9%. Macula OCT-A  may be an important adjunctive tool for identifying subjects at risk for developing glaucoma.​

Discussion:
Retinopathy in Chronic Myeloic Leukemia („Fundus leucaemicus“) is often associated with reduction of visual acuity. The ocular manifestations are unspecific, but characteristic for severe systemic diseases. Color fundus photograph show marked venous dilatation and tortuosity, cotton wool spots, and multiple retinal, preretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots. Large whitish retinal masses present temporally with satellite lesions at the posterior border are suggestive of retinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is helpful for quantification of the pathological retinal changes. Peripheral blood counts and differential haemograms are seminal for the diagnosis of CML.
