Numerous white spots distinct from exudates can be appreciated in the deep retina around the optic disc. Visual loss may be primarily macular in origin or may reflect a combination of optic nerve and macular dysfunction. Causes of neuroretinitis include cat scratch disease, syphilis, and a post-viral inflammatory reaction in the optic nerve.","<img src=""4247.jpg"">","Neuroretinitis refers to the constellation of optic disc swelling, radially-disposed exudates in the macula (""macular star"") and visual loss.  The exudates generally appear one to two weeks after the onset of symptoms.  In the case shown here, an indistinct whitish nodule appears to overlie the temporal aspect of the disc.  Also note the hemorrhagic appearance of the disc and the marked dilation of the retinal veins.","<img src=""4248.jpg"">"
