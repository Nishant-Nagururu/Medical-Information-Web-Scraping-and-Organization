Discussion: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, resulting in structural damage to the optic nerve head (ONH) and inner retina.  Approximately half of these retinal ganglion cells are located within 4.5 mm of the center of the fovea. The superficial capillaries mainly nourish the ganglion cell layer. Penteado RC (1) evaluated  in 185 eyes the association between macula vascular density assessed by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and central visual field (VF) threshold sensitivities in healthy, glaucoma suspect, and glaucoma patients.  He found  that  severe glaucoma subjects had significantly lower macula vessel density values compared with early glaucoma or healthy eyes.  They reported  that glaucoma eyes generally had sparser macula capillary networks compared with healthy eyes, glaucoma suspects, or mild glaucoma eyes. They documented an average macula vessel density  for healthy eyes  of 52.5%±3.7%, and for moderate/severe glaucoma patients  of 45.2%±3.9%. Macula OCT-A  may be an important adjunctive tool for identifying subjects at risk for developing glaucoma.​

Discussion:
Perfluorodecalin is a perfluorocarbon liquid used intraoperatively in retinal detachment repair. The clarity of perfluorocarbon liquids, with a refractive index is close to that of water. It is usually removed at the end of the procedure. However, residual amounts may be retained. Peyman et al. (1) reported, that perfluorocarbon liquids have been used to facilitate surgery in a wide variety of conditions, including proliferative vitreoretinopathy, giant retinal tears, drainage of suprachoroidal hemorrhages, diabetic traction, retinal detachments with a rhegmatogenous component, dislocated crystalline or intraocular lenses, and retinal detachment associated with choroidal coloboma. All perfluorocarbon liquids when used as tamponading agents can compress and disorganize the retina. This ""toxicity"" is a physical effect rather than chemical toxicity and depends upon the amount of perfluorocarbon liquid injected. Perfluorocarbon liquids are not tolerated in the anterior chamber, causing corneal edema within 2-3 days at the site of contact.

The retinal nerve fiber layer showed a decrease from 79 µm to 65 µma over 6 years.

Patient: 57 years of age, female,  autorefraction OD -2.5-0.25/180°, OS -2.75-0.25/5°, BCVA 1.0 at OD, 1.0 at OS, IOP RA 14 mmHg, IOP LA 14 mmHg, pachymetry OD 547 µm, OS 546 µm.
General Medical History: Hashimoto thyreoditis.
Ocular Medical History: in 2005 parapapillary bleedings with regular visual fields, the 24h-IOP profiles were always 14-16 mmHg at OD and OS without any therapy, there was a regular cerebral MRI . 
Main complaint: parapapillary bleedings.
Purpose: to show transition from pre-perimetric to perimetric glaucoma  with a clear glaucomatous change in the optic nerve head over an interval of 7 years  from 2006 to 2013.
Methods: Fundus Colour Image, w-w-Perimetry  30° Octopus G1, SD-OCT Heidelberg Engineering.
Findings:
Colour fundus imaging: showing a structural progression of the optic nerve head over 7 years  from 2006 to 2013, depicting in 2013 a parapapillary hemorrhage at 11h with minor changes in the retinal pigment epithelium.
Visual field : showing minor changes in the visual fields from 2006 to 2007, and in 2008 a clear scotoma. Over 7 years there was a mean loss of 1,2 dB/year and a functional defect of -8.7% per year with an acceleration in the last 3 years.

Dicussion: 
In POAG the loss of neuroretinal rim area per year could be very small. Mardin  (1) described, that a  glaucoma induced rim loss is very small per year and should be differentiated from regular age-related loss. The most pronounced loss in glaucoma  is temporal, both superior and inferior. Bengtsson et al (2) examined distributions of rates of progression from visual field series in pseudophakic eyes by Octopus perimeter (Haag Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland). They found in glaucoma patients a mean loss of 2.7%/year with the mean defect index MDI.

Patient: 58 years of age, male, BCVA 0.8 at OD, 0.7 at OS, IOP 16/14 mmHg.
Ocular Medical History: therapy with topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and prostaglandin analogs.
General Medical History: arterial hypertension.
Main Complaint: visual field defects at OS.
Purpose: to present glaucomatous optic nerve degeneration in a patient with small optic discs. 

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT-Spectralis, Visual Field, HRT.

Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: small optic discs with parapapillary atrophy,  no visible cupping. 
OCT: thinned  retinal nerve fiber layer with  43 µm at OD, 49 µm at OS.
Visual Field: visual field defects (OS>OD) with MD 5.0dB at OD, MD 6.5dB at OS.
HRT: small disc areas with  1.2 mm² at OD, 1.4mm² at OS, regular HRT-parameters.

Discussion:
Disc areas lower or equal 1.5 mm2 were defined as small discs. The detection of glaucoma focusses on the evaluation of morphometric changes in the optic nerve. Such abnormalities include changes in the optic disc area, cup area, and neuroretinal rim volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Assessment of the optic disc size is an essential component. Eyes with smaller discs might induce higher risks for developing and processing glaucomatous damage due to fewer optic nerve fibers and a smaller anatomic reserve capacity. Optic nerve fiber count correlates with optic disc area. (1)

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

Discussion: Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons, resulting in structural damage to the optic nerve head (ONH) and inner retina.  Approximately half of these retinal ganglion cells are located within 4.5 mm of the center of the fovea. The superficial capillaries mainly nourish the ganglion cell layer. Penteado RC (1) evaluated  in 185 eyes the association between macula vascular density assessed by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and central visual field (VF) threshold sensitivities in healthy, glaucoma suspect, and glaucoma patients.  He found  that  severe glaucoma subjects had significantly lower macula vessel density values compared with early glaucoma or healthy eyes.  They reported  that glaucoma eyes generally had sparser macula capillary networks compared with healthy eyes, glaucoma suspects, or mild glaucoma eyes. They documented an average macula vessel density  for healthy eyes  of 52.5%±3.7%, and for moderate/severe glaucoma patients  of 45.2%±3.9%. Macula OCT-A  may be an important adjunctive tool for identifying subjects at risk for developing glaucoma.​

Ocular Medical History: pseudoexfoliation material at anterior lens capsule, increased intraocular pressure in OS in secondary ocular hypertension in pseudoexfoliation syndrome. 
General Medical History: diabetes.
Main Complaint: blur at OS. 
Purpose: to explore the structural features in deep and superficial retinal layer of diabetic retinopathy using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and Fluorescence Angiography (FFA).
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, Fluorescence Angiography, Triton OCT, Triton OCT-Angiography
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: no retinal hemorrhages, no glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy.
Triton OCT, ring scan: regular retinal nerve fiber thickness.
FFA (0:39 s): several microaneurysms, one parafoveolar retinal hemorrhage.
Triton OCT-Angiography, Deep Retinal Layer: impaired capillary perfusion with several microaneurysms.
Triton OCT-Angiography, Superficial Retinal Layer: increased foveolar avascular zone, no microaneurysms.
Triton OCT-Angiography, Choriocapillaris: mainly regular capillary perfusion in choriocapillaris, less focal drop outs.
 Mosaic, FFA, Triton OCT-Angiography of Deep Retinal Layer: some microaneurysms confirmed by FFA are not visualized by OCTA, and some other microaneurysms confirmed by OCTA could not be visualized by FFA. 
Discussion: Microaneurysms are defined as hyperfluorescent spots in the early and/or late phases of Fluorescence Angiography. Hamada M  et al (1) found 90% of microaneurysms in the deep plexus. Ishibazawa A et al. (1) and Couturier et al. (2) reported an incomplete agreement between microaneurysms shown on FFA and those shown on OCTA. Several explanations are possible for why microaneurysms were not depicted by OCTA en face images but in FFA  and vice versa: absence of blood flow due to microaneurysm closure, microaneurysms with open lumens but without blood flow, and  thickened microaneurysm walls inhibiting the detection of flow signals.

Methods:
Colour Photography  Anterior Segment, SL-OCT 
Findings:
Colour Photography  Anterior Segment, before intracameral air injection: massive stromal edema due to leakage of aqueous through a tear in descemet membrane. 
SL-OCT, before intracameral air injection: Descemet's membrane detachment with dilaceration of collagen lamellae with large fluid-filled intrastromal cavity.
Colour Photography  Anterior Segment , 15 days after intracameral air injection: no stromal edema, posterior displacement of the hyperreflective structures with increased epithelial thickening and stromal thinning. 
Discussion:
Sandali et al. (1) proposed a Fourier-domain OCT classification containing 5 distinct keratoconus stages. Stage 1 demonstrates thinning of apparently normal epithelial and stromal layers at the conus. Stage 2 demonstrates hyperreflective anomalies occurring at the Bowman's layer level with epithelial thickening at the conus. Stage 3 demonstrates posterior displacement of the hyperreflective structures occurring at the Bowman's layer level with increased epithelial thickening and stromal thinning. Stage 4 demonstrates pan-stromal scar. Stage 5 demonstrates hydrops; 5a, acute onset: Descemet's membrane rupture and dilaceration of collagen lamellae with large fluid-filled intrastromal cysts; 5b, healing stage: pan-stromal scarring with a remaining aspect of Descemet's membrane rupture. 
Miyata et al. (2) found, that the intracameral air injection is a useful therapy to shorten the period of corneal edema in acute hydrops secondary to keratoconus.

In this photo, the Krimsky method is employed to measure the exotropia. The light reflex is almost centered with 45PD (Base inside), which is the extent of the horizontal prism bar shown. Some physicians also employ the MODIFIED Krimsky method where the prism is placed over the best or dominant eye. 
In this patient, using a 25 PD prism over EACH eye (50 PD in total), allowed for the light reflex to be perfectly centered (not shown in photo). Prism amounts can be added to each other when over each eye or a vertical and horizontal prism are stacked on top of each other but not when two horizontal or two vertical prisms are stacked on top of one eye.
The patient's vision is 20/25 OU. The patient complained of diplopia with prism correction greater than 40PD, suggesting a possible anomalous retinal correspondence (ARC). This can be assessed with various tests.","#Optho::Strabismus,OcularMotilityDisorders::Exodeviations::Case:DivergentConcomitantStrabismus","<img src=""7872.jpg"">","Patient has greater than 45 Prism Diopters of Exotropia.

Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked retinal dystrophy belonging to the family of blinding disorders. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. CHM is caused by mutations in the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1) gene, which encodes a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (1). Complete deletion of the CHM gene causes severe choroideremia.

Patient: 63 years of age, male, BCVA 0.5.
General Medical History: diabetes, arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: loss of visual acuity at OS.
Purpose: to present a retinal lesion, suggesting retinal macroaneurysma by FFA.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, Fluorescein Angiography, SD-OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: greyish-white lesion located close to the temporal upper retinal artery, intraretinal exudation, as a possible cause of visual deterioration. 
Fluorescein Angiography: slow filling, no retinal vein occlusion.
SD-OCT: circumferential dilation of the vessel wall, visible exsudates. 
Discussion:
Retinal arterial macroaneurysm (RAMA) is an acquired vessel dilation of branches of the central retinal artery. Risk factors include female gender, age over 60 years and arterial hypertension. The typical course of a RAMA starts with a growing phase, followed by gradual spontaneous fibrosis and/or thrombosis and finally involution without any therapy. In exudative RAMA, laser photocoagulation is an established therapy to induce thrombosis and promote reabsorption of exudates. Antiangiogenic intravitreal therapy has proven effective to close the RAMA and improve vision. Koinzer et al (1) examined N=49 charts of patients with RAMA and compared the long-term visual acuity (VA) in three groups according to treatment:  untreated, photocoagulation and vitrectomy. He found that VA remained unchanged in the observed and the laser groups after 3 years.

Ocular medical history: slow decrease of vision in OS.

General medical history: stenosis of ispilateral internal carotid artery, stroke in 2005. 

Main complaint: glare and decrease of vision at OS. 

Methods: colour photography.

Findings: 
Colour photography showed highly refractile multicolored ""needles"" crisscrossing the lens fibers. 

Discussion:
Christmas tree cataract consists of highly refractile multicolored ""needles"" crisscrossing the lens fibers of the deep cortex. The fact that the colors vary according to the angle of the incident light, and that in retroillumination only a dim outline of the cataract is seen, would suggest that Christmas tree cataract is a diffractive phenomenon. In a study 8 lenses with Christmas tree cataract were investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (1). They found that the needles are smooth, rectangular, plate-like elements bordered by membranes and amorphous material and running crisscross through the lens. The needles proved to be largely dissolved, but the remains showed regular spacings of approximately 5 nm. The needles have a high sulfur content and pronounced S-S, CS-SC, and C-S vibrations. The cytoplasm adjacent to the needles and reticular meshwork had an elevated Ca++ content. They concluded that cystine is the most likely candidate for the Christmas tree needles and that the needles probably are formed as the result of an age-related aberrant breakdown of crystallins induced by elevated Ca++ levels.

Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: nonperfused segment in superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, few intraretinal hemorrhages, no nerve fiber layer infarcts, no optic disc edema.
Fluorescein angiography (FA): nonperfused segment of superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, peripherial retinal neovascularisation, peripheral capillary nonperfusion with more than 10 disc diameters of retinal capillary nonperfusion.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT): decrease in foveal thickness, impaired inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, no macular swelling, no macular edema.
Discussion: 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause after diabetic retinopathy of vision loss due to retinal vascular disease. Branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is about 3-6 times more common than central vein occlusion (CRVO). Ho et al. (1) reported, that pooled data showed prevalence rates of about 0.52% for any RVO, 0.44% for BRVO, and 0.08% for CRVO. BRVO is caused by a combination of vein compression at arteriovenous crossings, degenerative changes within venous walls, and hypercoagulability. 34% of nonischemic retinal vein occlusion converted to the ischemic type. Kokolaki et al. (2) showed, that collateral vessels developed in 60% of patients 6±3 months after diagnosis.

General Medical History: arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: decreased vision in OD.

Purpose: to present peripherial ischemic retinopathy in mainly regular central fundus.
Methods: Colour Photogaphy Posterior Segment, Optical Coherence Tomography, Fundus Fluorescein Angiography.  
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: nonperfused segment in superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, few intraretinal hemorrhages, no nerve fiber layer infarcts, no optic disc edema.
Fluorescein angiography (FA): nonperfused segment of superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, peripherial retinal neovascularisation, peripheral capillary nonperfusion with more than 10 disc diameters of retinal capillary nonperfusion.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT): decrease in foveal thickness, impaired inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, no macular swelling, no macular edema.
Discussion: 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause after diabetic retinopathy of vision loss due to retinal vascular disease. Branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is about 3-6 times more common than central vein occlusion (CRVO). Ho et al. (1) reported, that pooled data showed prevalence rates of about 0.52% for any RVO, 0.44% for BRVO, and 0.08% for CRVO. BRVO is caused by a combination of vein compression at arteriovenous crossings, degenerative changes within venous walls, and hypercoagulability. 34% of nonischemic retinal vein occlusion converted to the ischemic type. Kokolaki et al. (2) showed, that collateral vessels developed in 60% of patients 6±3 months after diagnosis.

Ocular Medical History: since two weeks red and painful left eye, no decrease of vision.
General Medical History: CRP 1,4 mg%, no sign of sarcoidosis in x-ray.
Main Complaint: pain at OS.
Purpose: showing scleral nodule.
Methods: Colour photography.
Findings: 
Along with areas of diffuse scleral inflammation, a discrete, raised, scleral nodule is seen near the limbus at the 3 o’clock position.

Discussion:
Nodular scleritis can present as isolated condition or as part of a systemic inflammatory or infectious disorder. It is a serious ocular condition that can result in vision loss. Two-thirds of patients with non-infectious scleritis require systemic glucocorticoid therapy, and one fourth need a glucocorticoid-sparing agent, as well. Jabs et al (1) reported  in a retrospective study of 97 patients with scleritis, that 30% required nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone, 31% required oral glucocorticoids, and 26% required immunosuppressive drugs in addition to glucocorticoids to control their disease. Nodular anterior scleritis responded more often to NSAIDs (57%), whereas necrotizing scleritis often required systemic immunosuppressive drugs (70%).  Scleritis can occur in any age group but usually presents between ages 30 and 50  and women are affected approximately twice more often than men. There is no racial or geographic predilection. There is no known HLA association. The prevalence of scleritis in the general population is estimated to be 6 cases per 100,000 people. It has been described up to 7% of those with Wegener’s granulomatosis. Fong et al (2) discussed the pathogenesis of scleritis. They found that  the data available support an important  role for T cells in the inflammatory process. Inflammatory cells, mostly T cells and macrophages, are found on biopsy specimens.

Discussion:
The Swedish Thalidomide Study (1987–1989) [1-4] described the ophthalmologic findings of thalidomide-exposed embryos: incomitant strabismus, usually of the Duane type, aberrant tearing, coloboma, microphthalmia, and facial nerve palsy. Thalidomide [α-(N-phthalimido)-glutarimide] was synthesized in 1954 under the brand name of Contergan. Thalidomide was a popular treatment for anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and hyperemesis. Thalidomide is an extremely potent teratogenic drug capable of causing severe systemic malformations to an exposed fetus during the sensitive period. In addition to limb anomalies, craniofacial anomalies, ocular motility dysfunction and structural eye malformations were reported. Approximately 5000 cases of malformed live births occurred worldwide. The survival rate of thalidomide-exposed embryos was estimated to be between 40 and 50%. More than 10 000 pregnancies may have been affected. Thalidomide caused malformations primarily between 20 and 36 days after fertilization.

Discussion
Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula (1). Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is increasingly performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was reported (2) that most of the patients who had undergone SelAH had homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects contralateral to the side of the surgery.

MRI: FLAIR sequences on the level of the midbrain / LGN demonstrating the gliotic defect (arrow) after partial temporal lobe resection (Taylor-resection), (*) extending into the very ventral part of the optic radiation (Meyer´s loop) 
Discussion
Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula (1). Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is increasingly performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was reported (2) that most of the patients who had undergone SelAH had homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects contralateral to the side of the surgery.

SD-Optical Coherence Tomography: increased reflectivity of the inner foveal retina with a hyporeflective area of the underlying retinal pigment epithelium.
Discussion:
Solar retinopathy or eclipse retinopathy is a macular damage resulting from viewing of a solar eclipse. Chen et al. (1) reported, that visual deterioration from solar retinopathy typically ranges from 6/9 to 6/60 and in most cases the visual loss is reversible. The visual prognosis of solar retinopathy is usually favourable. Retinal damage is caused by photochemical changes combined with a rise in temperature at the time of sun observation (2).

Discussion:
The Swedish Thalidomide Study (1987–1989) [1-4] described the ophthalmologic findings of thalidomide-exposed embryos: incomitant strabismus, usually of the Duane type, aberrant tearing, coloboma, microphthalmia, and facial nerve palsy. Thalidomide [α-(N-phthalimido)-glutarimide] was synthesized in 1954 under the brand name of Contergan. Thalidomide was a popular treatment for anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and hyperemesis. Thalidomide is an extremely potent teratogenic drug capable of causing severe systemic malformations to an exposed fetus during the sensitive period. In addition to limb anomalies, craniofacial anomalies, ocular motility dysfunction and structural eye malformations were reported. Approximately 5000 cases of malformed live births occurred worldwide. The survival rate of thalidomide-exposed embryos was estimated to be between 40 and 50%. More than 10 000 pregnancies may have been affected. Thalidomide caused malformations primarily between 20 and 36 days after fertilization.

Discussion:
The Swedish Thalidomide Study (1987–1989) [1-4] described the ophthalmologic findings of thalidomide-exposed embryos: incomitant strabismus, usually of the Duane type, aberrant tearing, coloboma, microphthalmia, and facial nerve palsy. Thalidomide [α-(N-phthalimido)-glutarimide] was synthesized in 1954 under the brand name of Contergan. Thalidomide was a popular treatment for anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and hyperemesis. Thalidomide is an extremely potent teratogenic drug capable of causing severe systemic malformations to an exposed fetus during the sensitive period. In addition to limb anomalies, craniofacial anomalies, ocular motility dysfunction and structural eye malformations were reported. Approximately 5000 cases of malformed live births occurred worldwide. The survival rate of thalidomide-exposed embryos was estimated to be between 40 and 50%. More than 10 000 pregnancies may have been affected. Thalidomide caused malformations primarily between 20 and 36 days after fertilization.

Discussion: 
Arterial hypertension may cause cerebral, renal, cardiac and retinal end-organ damage. Hypertensive optic neuropathy and optic disk edema leads to hypoxia at the optic nerve head producing proximal axoplasmic flow stasis and secondary axonal swelling. Retinal hypertensive abnormalities are correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease in general but are not included in cardio vascular risk assessment tools. Kolman et al. (1) evaluated the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy and the association with other signs of end-organ-damage in 280 patients with arterial  hypertension. He found, that in 44% of patients referred to the clinic were diagnosed with hypertensive retinopathy, while 15 and 11% were diagnosed with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy LVH and microalbuminuria, respectively. Patients with isolated hypertensive retinopathy  consisted of 31% of all patients. When hypertensive retinopathy was added as a form of end-organ-damage , the percentage of patients with a treatment indication increased from 3 to 14%.

Discussion:
Ectopia lentis classically presents with a preceding history of blunt ocular trauma, or it may be associated with other ocular disorders such as congenital glaucoma and aniridia, or concomitant hereditary systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria. Ectopia lentis is a condition in which the crystalline lens is displaced from its normal position in the eye. A zonular weakening occurs in conjunction with a systemic disease like Homocystinuria or Marfan syndrome. Normal levels of plasma homocysteine are between 5–15 µmol/l l and concentrations between 16–30 µmol/l is mild, 31- 100nmol/ml is moderate, and greater than 100 µmol/l  is severe hyperhomocystinuria. Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by inborn error of metabolism due to deficiency of cystathionine beta synthase resulting in systemic accumulation of homocysteine and methionine and causing multisystem disorder of connective tissues, muscles, nervous system, and cardiovascular system. In European populations, prevalence of homocystinuria is around 1 in 10.000. In the presented case we found a level of plasma homocysteine of 11.5 µmol/l.

The severe preeclampsia variant, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), occurs in approximately 20-25% of women with severe preeclampsia . It is named not only for the liver involvement but also for the disorder of the coagulation system which develops. Approximately 20% of women with HELLP syndrome develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, which carries a poor prognosis for both mother and fetus. Conditions other than preeclampsia can cause serous retinal detachments and choroidal thickening. Central serous retinopathy is hypothesized to be due to an overactivation of mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in the choroidal vasculature.

General Medical History: diabetes, level of plasma was Hba1c 8%, level of plasma homocysteine was 11.5 µmol/l. 
Main Complaint: decrease in vision.
Purpose: to present a bilateral partial dislocation of the crystalline lens .
Methods: Colour Photography Anterior Segment
Findings:
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: partial dislocation of the crystalline lens in right eye.
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: partial dislocation of the crystalline lens in left eye.
Discussion:
Ectopia lentis classically presents with a preceding history of blunt ocular trauma, or it may be associated with other ocular disorders such as congenital glaucoma and aniridia, or concomitant hereditary systemic diseases such as Marfan syndrome and homocystinuria. Ectopia lentis is a condition in which the crystalline lens is displaced from its normal position in the eye. A zonular weakening occurs in conjunction with a systemic disease like Homocystinuria or Marfan syndrome. Normal levels of plasma homocysteine are between 5–15 µmol/l l and concentrations between 16–30 µmol/l is mild, 31- 100nmol/ml is moderate, and greater than 100 µmol/l  is severe hyperhomocystinuria. Homocystinuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by inborn error of metabolism due to deficiency of cystathionine beta synthase resulting in systemic accumulation of homocysteine and methionine and causing multisystem disorder of connective tissues, muscles, nervous system, and cardiovascular system. In European populations, prevalence of homocystinuria is around 1 in 10.000. In the presented case we found a level of plasma homocysteine of 11.5 µmol/l.

Patient: 58 years of age, male, BCVA 0.8 at OD, 0.7 at OS, IOP 16/14 mmHg.
Ocular Medical History: therapy with topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and prostaglandin analogs.
General Medical History: arterial hypertension.
Main Complaint: visual field defects at OS.
Purpose: to present glaucomatous optic nerve degeneration in a patient with small optic discs. 

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT-Spectralis, Visual Field, HRT.

Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: small optic discs with parapapillary atrophy,  no visible cupping. 
OCT: thinned  retinal nerve fiber layer with  43 µm at OD, 49 µm at OS.
Visual Field: visual field defects (OS>OD) with MD 5.0dB at OD, MD 6.5dB at OS.
HRT: small disc areas with  1.2 mm² at OD, 1.4mm² at OS, regular HRT-parameters.

Discussion:
Disc areas lower or equal 1.5 mm2 were defined as small discs. The detection of glaucoma focusses on the evaluation of morphometric changes in the optic nerve. Such abnormalities include changes in the optic disc area, cup area, and neuroretinal rim volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Assessment of the optic disc size is an essential component. Eyes with smaller discs might induce higher risks for developing and processing glaucomatous damage due to fewer optic nerve fibers and a smaller anatomic reserve capacity. Optic nerve fiber count correlates with optic disc area. (1)

The size of infiltrate was 7 mm without presence of hypopyon. 

Patient: 33 years of age, female, BCVA light perception at OD.
Ocular Medical history: wear of a daily wear rigid gas permeable contact lens. Sudden begin of subjective symptoms with decreased vision. The interval between symptoms and presentation at the hospital was 3 days. Corneal scraping was obtained.  The microbial analysis resulted in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Due to a perforation of the central infiltrate the eye required corneal transplantation.
General Medical History: empty.
Purpose: to present corneal infiltration due to wear of contact lenses. 
Methods: Colour imaging.
Findings:
Colour image: flat anterior chamber with a central spontaneous corneal perforation combined with a stromal infiltrate. The size of infiltrate was 7 mm without presence of hypopyon. 

Discussion:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequently isolated microorganism in contact lens wearers. It was reported (1), that the estimated annual incidence of microbial keratitis per 10,000 contact lens wearers, depending on lens type and wearing schedule, ranges between 1.2 for daily wear rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses and 25.4 for extended wear of silicone hydrogel lenses. Microbial keratitis is a serious complication of contact lens wear, with approximately one out of five cases requiring corneal transplantation. Hoddenbach et al. (2) investigated the clinical presentation, isolated organism, treatment, and morbidity of contact lens-associated microbial keratitis needing hospitalization. He included 109 consecutive patients with contact lens-associated microbial keratitis from 2005 to 2009. In 69% Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated. Ofloxacin, or a combination of gentamicin and cephazolin, was suggested as an excellent first-choice therapy. In his study after intensive treatment 67 %  achieved a BCVA ≥ 0.7 Snellen and 20 % required corneal transplantation.

Discussion:
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequently isolated microorganism in contact lens wearers. It was reported (1), that the estimated annual incidence of microbial keratitis per 10,000 contact lens wearers, depending on lens type and wearing schedule, ranges between 1.2 for daily wear rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses and 25.4 for extended wear of silicone hydrogel lenses. Microbial keratitis is a serious complication of contact lens wear, with approximately one out of five cases requiring corneal transplantation. Hoddenbach et al.

Discussion: Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity across the world. This condition complicates approximately 3% to 7% of pregnancies, and the severe form affects 0.6% to 1.2% of pregnancies. Preeclampsia can cause grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy with hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, hard exudates in the macular region, and swelling of the optic disks. The severe preeclampsia variant, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), occurs in approximately 20-25% of women with severe preeclampsia . It is named not only for the liver involvement but also for the disorder of the coagulation system which develops. Approximately 20% of women with HELLP syndrome develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, which carries a poor prognosis for both mother and fetus. Conditions other than preeclampsia can cause serous retinal detachments and choroidal thickening. Central serous retinopathy is hypothesized to be due to an overactivation of mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in the choroidal vasculature.

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

Testing Humphrey visual field showed visual field defects that correspond to ischemic retina.  On an interesting note, the depressed areas of the visual field is inferior, as the vein occlusion was superior; this is expected since the superior field of the eye is responsible for inferior vision.  Onto another interesting item on visual field is that the vein occlusion respected the horizontal midline as seen in visual field test and corresponds to the vein occlusion.  According to a study done in 2011 by Archives of Ophthalmology, patients with a retinal vein occlusion are shown to be twice at risk for cerebrovascular accident, but not heart attack.

Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis was confirmed on temporal artery biopsy. 
General medical history: headache.
Purpose: to present anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in both eyes in giant cell arteritis.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT.
Findings:

Discussion:
Arteritis temporalis shows a variable course of the disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss. Hayeh et al. (1) reported, that patients with giant cell arteritis presented a variety of ocular symptoms : visual loss of varying severity in 98%, amaurosis fugax in 31%, diplopia in 6%, and eye pain in 8%. Because giant cell arteritis is a potentially blinding disease and its early diagnosis is the key to preventing blindness, it is important to recognize its various ocular manifestations. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ infarction (2).

OCT: subretinal fluid, retinal exudation. 
Discussion:
Coats' disease (retinal telangiectasis) is a sporadic disorder characterized by a defect in retinal vascular development resulting in vessel leakage, subretinal exudation and retinal detachment. Black GC et al. (1) has indicated probable role of somatic mutation in the NDP gene in the pathogenesis of Coats' disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified (2) as a key regulator in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Coats' disease demonstrates vascular abnormalities, associated exudation, and manifests as teleangiectasia and aneurysms. Exudative subretinal lipid deposits can be extensive. Coats' disease is unilateral and affects predominantly healthy young males. Joussen AM (3) suggested that Coats' disease as a progressive disease requires lifelong follow-up and therapy. Treatment consisted of cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation and bevacizumab intravitreal injection.

Discussion:
Disc areas lower or equal 1.5 mm2 were defined as small discs. The detection of glaucoma focusses on the evaluation of morphometric changes in the optic nerve. Such abnormalities include changes in the optic disc area, cup area, and neuroretinal rim volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Assessment of the optic disc size is an essential component. Eyes with smaller discs might induce higher risks for developing and processing glaucomatous damage due to fewer optic nerve fibers and a smaller anatomic reserve capacity. Optic nerve fiber count correlates with optic disc area. (1)

Discussion:
Arteritis temporalis shows a variable course of the disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss. Hayeh et al. (1) reported, that patients with giant cell arteritis presented a variety of ocular symptoms : visual loss of varying severity in 98%, amaurosis fugax in 31%, diplopia in 6%, and eye pain in 8%. Because giant cell arteritis is a potentially blinding disease and its early diagnosis is the key to preventing blindness, it is important to recognize its various ocular manifestations. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ infarction (2).

Discussion:
The caruncle is a nodular structure lying at the internal canthus, medial to the plica semilunaris. The caruncle is widely exposed in the palpebral aperture. Patients or physicians easily notice changes in its appearance. It was reported the types and incidence of caruncular lesions (1) of a total of 195 consecutive caruncular lesions from 191 patients. The most common type were nevi (47%) and papillomas (15%). They found that 94% were benign, 3% were premalignant, and 2.6% were malignant. It was concluded, that malignancy is clinically overestimated, and some malignant lesions can take a benign aspect, justifying close photographic follow-up of all lesions. Because caruncular malignant melanoma is associated with poor prognosis, pigmented lesions should be monitored carefully. In the absence of clear criteria for malignancy, any change in color, size, or vascularization of a caruncular lesion should hasten excision.
