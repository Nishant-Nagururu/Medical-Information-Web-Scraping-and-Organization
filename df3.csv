General Medical History: empty.
Ocular Medical History: The patient slowly developed 3 mm of well-tolerated relative proptosis with minimal motility disturbance at OS, no visual decline. 
Main Complaint: proptosis with motility disturbance.
Methods: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visual evoked response (VEP).
Findings: 
(1) Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated an intraconal rounded mass that perfused slowly, the anterior surface was well circumscribed. There was no compression of the optic nerve.
(2) VEP of OS showed regular latencies with attenuated amplitudes at OS.
Discussion: Bonavolontà  et al. (1) evaluated the frequencies of orbital space-occupying lesions. In this retrospective case series, the authors reviewed 2,480 consecutive patients. Of the 2,480 lesions, 68% were benign and 32% were malignant. The most frequent benign tumors were dermoid cyst (14%) and cavernous hemangioma (9%). The most common malignant tumors were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (12%), basal cell carcinoma (3%), and orbital metastases (3%). Cavernous hemangioma only exceptionally compresses the optic nerve.

Etiologies of optic disk edema include also elevated intracranial pressure, inflammation, infection, demyelination, ischemia, compression, infiltration, toxic insults, metabolic deficiency, and mitochondrial disorders. Presence of a macular star figure in combination of optic disk swelling suggests inflammation, infection, increased ICP, or ischemia.

https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/photo.jsf?node=5831&locale=en,tonic pupil,"Top: This 29-year-old man reported that his right pupil had been dilated for six weeks.  On direct light stimulation, the right pupil showed minimal reaction while that on the left reacted normally.  Slit lamp examination revealed that the dysfunction of the iris sphincter muscle in the right eye was sectoral, with some segments retaining contractile ability and others showing complete paralysis.  Eyelids and ocular motility were normal.
Bottom: Following instillation of weak-strength (0.125%) pilocarpine into both eyes, the right pupil constricts to the point where it is smaller than the left pupil.  The demonstration of this phenomenon, termed denervation supersensitivity, helps to confirm the diagnosis of tonic pupil.

Unilateral or bilateral tonic pupils reflect damage to post-ganglionic parasympathetic fibers, either at the level of the ciliary ganglion or along the course of the short ciliary nerves.

Bottom:In relative darkness, the anisocoria is markedly diminished.

Anisocoria that is more pronounced in bright light than in dim light suggests that the larger pupil is the abnormal one and that the clinical signs reflect parasympathetic dysfunction.  Note, however, that there are a number of exceptions to this general rule.
","<img src=""5832.jpg"">","Top:The anisocoria in this patient is due to a tonic pupil in the right eye, based on the concurrence of sectoral palsy of the iris sphincter and denervation supersensitivity to weak-strength miotics.
Bottom: When the patient fixates on a near target, the dilated right pupil constricts slowly and progressively until it becomes slightly smaller than the simultaneously constricted left pupil.  This is an example of light-near dissociation.  In patients with unilateral or bilateral tonic pupils, light-near dissociation is due to aberrant reinnervation of the paretic iris sphincter muscle by fibers that originally innervated the ciliary muscle.

Patient:71-year-old Caucasian woman, BCVA 0.3 at OD, 0.3 at OS; IOP 12/14 mmHg.
Ocular Medical History: 2-year history of redness, irritation, and foreign body sensation in both eyes, treated with topical corticosteroids without improvement.
General medical history: presented due to ocular symptoms but, on initial evaluation were found systemic manifestations consistent with Wegener granulomatosis, diagnosed on the basis of clinical and histopathologic features. The patient was treated with Rituximap 1000 mg and oral prednisone, 25 mg/day. Recurrent pulmonary inflammation developed and serologies for cytoplasmic-pattern antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (C-ANCA) became positive.
Main complaints: ocular irritation for the previous year, conjunctival and scleral ulceration of the left eye
PURPOSE: To describe a patient with Wegener granulomatosis, presented due to ocular symptoms but, on initial evaluation were found to have occult systemic manifestations.
Findings:
Colour photography anterior segment (OS): diffuse conjunctival injection, focal vasculitis manifested by scleritis. No peripheral corneal thinning, anterior chamber quiet and deep.
Discussion:
In Wegener granulomatosis focal vasculitis is manifested by conjunctivitis, episcleritis, scleritis, corneoscleral ulceration, uveitis, and granulomatous vasculitis of the retina and optic nerve. Although ocular manifestations are relatively common in Wegener granulomatosis, the eyelid and its conjunctival lining are rarely involved (1). When this area is the initial focus of the disease, diagnosis may be difficult. Wegener granulomatosis has a variety of uncommon initial presentations. Although conjunctival involvement in this condition is rare, the diagnosis of Wegener granulomatosis should be suspected when the conjunctival inflammation is recurrent and not typical of other conjunctival inflammatory conditions. Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is an etiologically obscure entity with multiple systemic manifestations. Ocular involvement is present in up to 58% of patients with WG. Harper et al (2) reported from 47 patients diagnosed with WG: 57.4% had systemic disease first and subsequently developed an ocular lesion, 6.3% had ocular inflammation first and then subsequently developed systemic manifestations of WG,  6.3% presented due to ocular symptoms but, on initial evaluation were found to have occult systemic manifestations consistent with WG, 30% had ocular lesions and no history or presence of systemic disease. He concluded, that ocular inflammation can occur with or without obvious systemic manifestations of WG. Ocular inflammation may represent the first sign of WG that enables the knowledgeable physician to diagnose this potentially lethal disease.

When this area is the initial focus of the disease, diagnosis may be difficult. Wegener granulomatosis has a variety of uncommon initial presentations. Although conjunctival involvement in this condition is rare, the diagnosis of Wegener granulomatosis should be suspected when the conjunctival inflammation is recurrent and not typical of other conjunctival inflammatory conditions. Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) is an etiologically obscure entity with multiple systemic manifestations. Ocular involvement is present in up to 58% of patients with WG. Harper et al (2) reported from 47 patients diagnosed with WG: 57.4% had systemic disease first and subsequently developed an ocular lesion, 6.3% had ocular inflammation first and then subsequently developed systemic manifestations of WG,  6.3% presented due to ocular symptoms but, on initial evaluation were found to have occult systemic manifestations consistent with WG, 30% had ocular lesions and no history or presence of systemic disease. He concluded, that ocular inflammation can occur with or without obvious systemic manifestations of WG. Ocular inflammation may represent the first sign of WG that enables the knowledgeable physician to diagnose this potentially lethal disease.

Discussion:
Arteritis temporalis shows a variable course of the disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss. Hayeh et al. (1) reported, that patients with giant cell arteritis presented a variety of ocular symptoms : visual loss of varying severity in 98%, amaurosis fugax in 31%, diplopia in 6%, and eye pain in 8%. Because giant cell arteritis is a potentially blinding disease and its early diagnosis is the key to preventing blindness, it is important to recognize its various ocular manifestations. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ infarction (2).

Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

Only slight perifocal edema. The maximal extent is 68 x 43 x 58 mm. In summary, this lesion is most likely a central neurocytoma.
Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

Ocular Medical History: blurry vision at OD. 
General Medical History: no subjective symptoms, by chance detection of arterial hypertension with systolic blood pressure >200mmHg, chronic nephrotic insufficieny with serum creatinine concentration of 2,8 mg per deciliter, proteinuria with 294 mg/ml/day, hematuria 10/µl. Renal histology  revealed a hypertensive-ischemic nephropathy with arterio-arteriololo-sclerosis  of the kidney.
Purpose: to show the effect of antihypertensive medication in hypertensive retinopathy.

Discussion: 
Arterial hypertension may cause cerebral, renal, cardiac and retinal end-organ damage. Hypertensive optic neuropathy and optic disk edema leads to hypoxia at the optic nerve head producing proximal axoplasmic flow stasis and secondary axonal swelling. Retinal hypertensive abnormalities are correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease in general but are not included in cardio vascular risk assessment tools. Kolman et al.

This allowed detailed anatomic correlation between the artery and the vein, revealing that BRVO occurred at the arterial overcrossing in about 70% of the eyes investigated. At the venous overcrossing, the mechanical compression caused by the Inner Limiting Membrane ILM and the arterial walls at the crossing would be primarily related to the onset of BRVO. The affected veins were compressed and choked between the ILM and the arterial wall at the venous overcrossing.
