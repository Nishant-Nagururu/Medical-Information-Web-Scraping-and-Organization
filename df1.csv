Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

Discussion: 
Optic nerve head drusen are calcific deposits buried or at the surface of the optic disc. Nentwich et al. reported (1) that drusen of the optic disc occur in 0.34 to 2.4 % of human individuals. Within histological sections drusen are found six times more often than on funduscopic examination. Diagnostic tools include fundus-autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography and ultrasound. Fundus Autofluorescence  shows inherent autofluorescent properties of optic nerve head drusen. Drusen of the optic nerve head can lead to transient visual impairment, and to profound visual field defects in adulthood. The mechanism of drusen-related field loss is poorly understood. Tso (2) proposed that disc drusen are a consequence of abnormal axonal metabolism leading to the deposition of calcium crystals in mitochondria and disruption of axons with further accumulation of calcified cellular contents.

Retinopathy in Chronic Myeloic Leukemia („Fundus leucaemicus“) is often associated with reduction of visual acuity. The ocular manifestations are unspecific, but characteristic for severe systemic diseases. Color fundus photograph show marked venous dilatation and tortuosity, cotton wool spots, and multiple retinal, preretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots. Large whitish retinal masses present temporally with satellite lesions at the posterior border are suggestive of retinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is helpful for quantification of the pathological retinal changes. Peripheral blood counts and differential haemograms are seminal for the diagnosis of CML. First line therapy for CML is the application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Glivec). Ophthalmological adverse effects of this therapy, such as periorbital edema, are possible (1,2) .

Purpose: to present optic nerve head edema followed by atrophy as a consequence of maxillary sinusitis.
Methods: colour fundus photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), MRI (SiemensTrio), w-w-perimetry (Octpus G1).
Findings:
Colour photography, in October 2012: presenting an unilateral optic nerve head edema  with a parapapillary bleeding at 7h at OS 
SD-OCT, in October 2012: showing an edema of the optic nerve head at OS.
MRI, in October 2012: depicting a complete complete filling of left maxillary and frontal sinus.
W-w-perimetry, in November 2012: presenting a deep and large scotoma at OS.
SD-OCT, in March 2013: showing a decreased retinal nerve fiber layer at OS, and no edema of optic nerve head.
Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

Slit lamp photo showing overlap of the two ring segments that widened the channel, creating a fluid space.  However, the anterior (white arrow) and posterior (red arrow) walls of the channel remained intact. 

Patient: Female subject, 49 years old, preoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) 20/60 in left eye. 
Ocular Medical History: The patient was unable to tolerate rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens and chose ICRS implantation to improve vision. Intrastromal corneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation was performed. Major surgical procedures: Two 0.45 mm ICRS were implanted (Intacs, Addition Technology, Inc., Des Plaines, IL). The corneal channels were created with a femtosecond laser (iFS, Abbott Medical Optics Inc., Santa Ana, CA). The channel depth was set at 356 microns, 70% of the average pachymetry within the 6-9mm diameter zone (Orbscan II). A single 10-0 nylon suture was used to close the wound. One day after surgery, the BSCVA was improved. On the one month follow-up, the patient complained of eye irritation. To prevent further dissection into the optical zone, both segments were explanted. 

Main Complaint:T After surgery patient complained decreased visual acuity in both eyes without pain. 
Purpose: To report a case of unusual complication of ring segments migrated infranasally after 
Methods:Colour Image, optical coherence tomography (OCT, RTVue, Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA), Orbscan II.
Findings: 
Preoperative Findings:
Scanning-slit tomography/topography (Orbscan II, Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) showed moderate inferior steepening. 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT, RTVue, Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA): central pachymetry 429 µm
Orbscan II: showing average corneal thickness within 6-9 mm annual zone of 509 µm with minimum 486 µm. 

Postoperative Findings: 
One day after surgery
BSCVA: improving to 20/40. 
Slit lamp: showing ring segments in proper position. 

On the one month follow-up:
BSCVA: patient complained of eye irritation, BSCVA was 20/40-1.  
Slit lamp: showing both ring segments migrated infranasally, causing the tips to overlap.  At the point of overlap the intrastromal channels were widened and the tip of the inferotemporal segment had migrated centrally into the optical zone (Figure 1, 2). No edema or infiltration was observed.  
OCT: showing that both segments remained within the lamellar plane of the channel, and the relative depth of ring segments was 76% as measured at the inner edge (Figure 3). 

One day after removing the ICRS segment:
BSCVA: VA was 20/40+1.
Slit Lamp: The cornea had returned to its preoperative appearance except for faint haze in the ICRS channel.
 
Discussion: 
One of the most common complications of ICRS implantation is ring segment displacement. Two previous studies reported the complications after mechanical channel creation.  Kanellopoulos et al reported in 2006 six out of 20 keratoconus cases (30%) had ring segments movement about 3-6 months postoperatively.1 Such high incidence was not reported in other studies. Zare et al reported in 2007 ring segments displacement occurred in three out of 30 keratoconus cases (10%)  3-5 months after ICRS implantation.2 The reported incidence of ring segment migration with femtosecond laser channel creation was much lower. Coskunseven et al reported in 2011 that among 850 eyes, ring segment movement was observed in 11 (1.3%) cases at 2 months postoperatively.3 In these reported cases of ring migration, the movement was within the surgically created channel or incisional wound, or associated with corneal thinning and melting superficial to the segments,1,2 or protrusion through the Descemet’s membrane, 4 or even perforation into the anterior chamber.5 Dissection through the lateral wall of the channel had not been explicitly described. 
In our case, dissection of the ring segments in the corneal stromal happened one month after ICRS implantation, which is earlier than the range of 2-6 months reported in previous studies.2,3,6 There was intra-channel rotation of one segment while the other segment dissection along the lamellar plane of the channel toward the optical zone, which had not been reported before.  Several factors could have contributed to this pattern of dissection.  One is the thickness of the segments.  The 450 µm thick segments that was used was the maximum available, and only recently approved by the FDA for use in the US.  The thicker segment and overlapping tip could have created greater stress to split the cornea along the lamellar plane.  Another factor was the 76% depth.   Inter-lamellar corneal fibers decrease posteriorly and therefore deeper lamellar planes are easier to dissection.  Another factor was the relatively advanced nature of keratoconus in this case, with only 429 µm corneal thickness centrally.  Although this is above the 400 µm minimum needed to qualify for Intacs, it is thinner than most cases of ICRS implantation.5,7 
In conclusion, thick ICRS segments, deep implantation depth, and thin cornea may be the risk factors for lateral dissection and migration of ICRS segments. This suggests that ICRS may be safer for less advanced cases of keratoconus.

Paecilomyces is a rare cause of keratitis, but is an emerging fungal pathogen that infects corneal tissue by filamentous invasion with occasional intrastromal sporulation. The infection is difficult to eradicate because of multiple antifungal drug resistance and has a poor outcome.  Yuan et al . (1) described  the pathogenesis and outcome of Paecilomyces keratitis. He found, that of 42 reported eyes with Paecilomyces keratitis, 31% were associated with chronic keratopathy or previous ocular surgery, 26% followed corneal trauma, and 24% occurred in soft contact lens wearers. In vitro testing indicated resistance to natamycin and amphotericin B but susceptibility to ketoconazole and voriconazole. The study stated, that Paecilomyces keratitis  does not reliably respond to natamycin or amphotericin B and has often required therapeutic keratoplasty, but topical azole antifungal agents such as voriconazole appear promising.

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

Patient: 63 years of age, female, BCVA 0.8 at OD, 0.9 at OS; 
General Medical History: two months before, in Nov 2013 acute infarction of posterior cerebral artery, long standing arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: regular pseudophakia.
Main Complaint: altered visual field to the left side.
Purpose: to demonstrate complete visual field defect to the left side after posterior cerebral artery infarction.
Methods: Colour Photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), ww-Perimetry (Octopus G1), MRT (Siemens, TimTrio). 
Colour Photography OD& OS: pale optic nerve head (OD>OS), no cupping.
OCT OD& OS : minimal diffuse thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer.
ww-Perimetry OD& OS : complete homonymus visual defect to the left side.
MRI: in 11/2013 complete infarction of posterior cerebral artery (T1) (star).
MRI-DTI: in 01/2014 decreased axonal integrity in posterior part of optic radiation (arrow). 
Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

Patient: 84 years of age, female 
General Medical History: empty.

Findings:
Colour photography: corneal infiltrate  with retrocorneal  mycel  from 5.12.2013 and  from 10.12.2013.
Ultrasound: vitreous infiltration indicating fungous endophthalmitis. 
Discussion:
Paecilomyces is a rare cause of keratitis, but is an emerging fungal pathogen that infects corneal tissue by filamentous invasion with occasional intrastromal sporulation. The infection is difficult to eradicate because of multiple antifungal drug resistance and has a poor outcome.  Yuan et al . (1) described  the pathogenesis and outcome of Paecilomyces keratitis. He found, that of 42 reported eyes with Paecilomyces keratitis, 31% were associated with chronic keratopathy or previous ocular surgery, 26% followed corneal trauma, and 24% occurred in soft contact lens wearers. In vitro testing indicated resistance to natamycin and amphotericin B but susceptibility to ketoconazole and voriconazole. The study stated, that Paecilomyces keratitis  does not reliably respond to natamycin or amphotericin B and has often required therapeutic keratoplasty, but topical azole antifungal agents such as voriconazole appear promising.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

Ocular Medical History: Unilateral increased intraocular pressure in OS since 2013, filtrating surgery in OS in 2014.
General Medical History: arterial hypertension.
Purpose: to present optic pit in glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, Optical Coherence Tomography, Visual Field.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: thinned rim and optic disc pit at the inferotemporal periphery of the optic disc.

Discussion: 
Choi et al. (1) reported that optic disc pits had a diverse structure according to the alteration of the lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue. Optic disc pit is often associated with a corresponding scotoma. Choi et al. (1) suggested, that a compliant lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue may become susceptible to the damaging effects of increased IOP values. The ongoing insult to the optic nerve may then influence the lamina cribrosa tissue or prelaminar tissue, exhibiting the appearance of alteration in the lamina cribrosa or or prelaminar tissue. Subsequently, the axons passing through the altered lamina cribrosa and or prelaminar tissue are likely to be damaged by loss of structural support, loss of nutrient supply from laminar capillaries, or loss of metabolic support from astrocytes.

General Medical History:  in October 2012, 14.000 leucocytes, MRI revealing  maxillary sinusitis at left side, followed by maxillary surgery next day .
Main Complaint: loss of vision at OS.
Purpose: to present optic nerve head edema followed by atrophy as a consequence of maxillary sinusitis.
Methods: colour fundus photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), MRI (SiemensTrio), w-w-perimetry (Octpus G1).
Findings:
Colour photography, in October 2012: presenting an unilateral optic nerve head edema  with a parapapillary bleeding at 7h at OS 
SD-OCT, in October 2012: showing an edema of the optic nerve head at OS.
MRI, in October 2012: depicting a complete complete filling of left maxillary and frontal sinus.
W-w-perimetry, in November 2012: presenting a deep and large scotoma at OS.
SD-OCT, in March 2013: showing a decreased retinal nerve fiber layer at OS, and no edema of optic nerve head.
Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

General Medical History: empty. Ocular Medical History: injury of the eye during work. Main complaint: sudden loss of vision and pain. Methods: Colour photography, cranial Computer Tomography. Findimgs: (1) Colour photography: Colour image reveals a corneal opening, a flat anterior chamber, an iris injury, and a rupture of the crystalline lens. (2) Cranial Computer Tomography: CCT showed an intraocular foreign body (arrow). Discussion: Work-related injuries can cause significant morbidity in a young population of patients. Occupational injuries are common. In 2004 in the United States there were 1.3 million injuries that resulted in at least 1 day of missed work. Of these work-related injuries, 36 680 involved the eye. The lifetime prevalence of work-related eye injuries among US workers is 4.4% (1). Bauza et al. (2) analyzed the clinical characteristics of a total of 183 eyes with work-related open globe injuries. He found that the majority of injuries occurred in men (96.7%), and the most common cause was nail gun use (47.0%). Intraocular foreign bodies were found in 21%. Presenting visual acuity (VA) was worse than 20/200 in 66% and no light perception in 6%. Final visual acuity worse than 20/200 occurred in 37%. Significant prognostic factors for a final visual acuity of no light perception were rupture injury, and initial visual acuity of no light perception. Literature: (1) K.Y.Z. Forrest, J.M. Cali.

Patient: 63 years of age, female, BCVA 0.8 at OD, 0.9 at OS; 
General Medical History: two months before, in Nov 2013 acute infarction of posterior cerebral artery, long standing arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: regular pseudophakia.
Main Complaint: altered visual field to the left side.
Purpose: to demonstrate complete visual field defect to the left side after posterior cerebral artery infarction.
Methods: Colour Photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), ww-Perimetry (Octopus G1), MRT (Siemens, TimTrio). 
Colour Photography OD& OS: pale optic nerve head (OD>OS), no cupping.
OCT OD& OS : minimal diffuse thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer.
ww-Perimetry OD& OS : complete homonymus visual defect to the left side.
MRI: in 11/2013 complete infarction of posterior cerebral artery (T1) (star).
MRI-DTI: in 01/2014 decreased axonal integrity in posterior part of optic radiation (arrow). 
Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

Discussion:
Arteritis temporalis shows a variable course of the disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss. Hayeh et al. (1) reported, that patients with giant cell arteritis presented a variety of ocular symptoms : visual loss of varying severity in 98%, amaurosis fugax in 31%, diplopia in 6%, and eye pain in 8%. Because giant cell arteritis is a potentially blinding disease and its early diagnosis is the key to preventing blindness, it is important to recognize its various ocular manifestations. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ infarction (2).

Bottom Photo: After application of phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1%, the right pupil remains fixed and dilated in all lighting situations. In this photo, the flashlight is being applied to the right eye to show the intact light reflex. Detection of an afferent pupillary defect requires only one working pupil. In this case, an intact light reflex is present because the contralateral eye (left) constricts even if the pupil is abnormal (right eye). In this case, no afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn Pupil) is present in right eye because left pupil constricts when light is applied to right pupil. 

phenylephrine 2.5% and tropicamide 1% are used to dillate pupils for eye exams and intraocular surgery because together their dilating effects last 2-8 hours. Other mydriatics such as homatropine and atropine dilate the eye for days and are useful for cycloplegic refractions and treating intraocular inflammation. Atropine ointments are used in infants because drops can be absorbed systemically more easilly and cause systemic side effects.

Discussion: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of blindness in most industrialized nations. Diabetic macular  edema is characterised by exudative fluid accumulation in the macula. It affects one in 15 people with diabetes resulting in more than 20 million cases worldwide. Pathogenesis of DME is related to the breakdown of the blood–retina barrier, leaking microaneurysms , upregulated cytokine, and other factors. Enhanced expression of the proangiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A has been validated in patients with DME. Hasegawa N  et al. (1) demonstrated that the density of the microaneurysms in the deep capillary plexus (DCP)  was significantly associated with the macular edema volume and that microaneurysms contributed to the pathogenesis of DME.

General Medical History: empty.
Ocular Medical History: no visual problems, routine checkup to rule out glaucoma.
Main Complaint: no complaints.
PURPOSE:  To describe a peripapillary and macular retinoschisis, only visible by OCT.
Methods: Colour fundus photography, w-w-perimetry (Octopus G1), fluorescein angiography (HRA, Heidelberg Engineering),  SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering).
Colour fundus photography: no glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy, no epiretinal gliosis.
W-w-perimetry : peripheral scotoma.
Frequency Doubling Technique FDT: paracentral scotoma.
OCT: large peripapillary retinoschisis, including the macular area,  mimicking a true retinoschisis cavity, although bridging retinal elements were identifiable. Cavity within cup suggests optic pit (arrow). No evidence of choroidal neovascular membrane.
Fluorescein Angiography : showing minor  leakage on fluorescein angiography within the optic disk (arrow), indicating location of the cavity. No evidence of choroidal neovascular membrane.

Discussion: 
The etiology of the peripapillary and macular retinoschisis is uncertain. There was no history of acute rises in IOP. A congenital optic pit could not be found by ophthalmoscopy. We hypothesized that there might be a communicating bridge connecting the cavity within the optic nerve head and the peripapillary  retinoschisis, which was found in  the fluorescein angiography .  Zumbro et al  (1) hypothesized that fluctuations in IOP played a role in vitreous traction and the development of retinoschisis. They supposed that acute elevations in IOP may have led to small changes in axial length or severe optic nerve cupping that allowed vitreous to enter the retina. As there were no severe fluctuations in IOP of our case, but a minor leakage in the optic cup was observed, we believe that the retinoretinoschisis is the result of a structural defect in the optic nerve in the optic disk. Microholes in the thinning and structural defects areas in the optic cup allowed liquid vitreous to enter the retina via the nerve fiber layer. The fluid caused retinal edema, followed by  a retinoschisis. Macular and peripapillary retinoschisis can occur in patients with presumed enlarged optic nerve head cups in the absence of obvious congenital anomalies of the disk. We believe the cause is leakage of fluid through a tiny hole in the thin tissue of the cup. This is a similar mechanism to that seen in patients with optic pits

Discussion: 
Chlamydia trachomatis is a ubiquitos pathogen worldwide and causes ocular, urogenital and respiratory infections in humans. An estimated 92 million new cases of Chlamydia trachomatis infection occur each year (1). About 0.3%-2% of genital infection with Chlamydia trachomatis are complicated by a chlamydial eye infection (2). Ocular localizations of C. trachomatis are typically observed among neonates and infants who acquire the infection while passing through the birth canal. Chlamydial conjunctivitis may also occur in adolescents following a genital infection. Chlamydial conjunctivitis affects initially one eye and the incubation period varies from 4 to 12 days. Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) are currently recommended as the first diagnostic choice.

Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

Discussion: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of blindness in most industrialized nations. Diabetic macular  edema is characterised by exudative fluid accumulation in the macula. It affects one in 15 people with diabetes resulting in more than 20 million cases worldwide. Pathogenesis of DME is related to the breakdown of the blood–retina barrier, leaking microaneurysms , upregulated cytokine, and other factors. Enhanced expression of the proangiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A has been validated in patients with DME. Hasegawa N  et al. (1) demonstrated that the density of the microaneurysms in the deep capillary plexus (DCP)  was significantly associated with the macular edema volume and that microaneurysms contributed to the pathogenesis of DME.

Discussion:
It was shown by Liu et al. (1) that progression and regression of DR were strongly associated with blood pressure and glycemic exposure.  In a huge study they investigated the progression and regression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the effects of population risk factors on the rates of transition across retinopathy stages. From 1990 to 2011   4,758 diabetic patients who were diagnosed at 35 years of age or older were observed. They found a consistent risk effect of HbA1c on the progression  from no retinopathy to mild background DR a hazard ratio per SD of HbA1c  of 1.42, from mild BDR to observable BDR a hazard ratio of 1.32, and from observable BDR to severe nonproliferative/proliferative DR a hazard ratio of 2.23. Similarly, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure increased the risk for the transition from the asymptomatic phase to mild BDR  with a hazard ratio of 1.20 and from the mild BDR to observable BDR with a hazard ratio of 1.87, respectively. Regression from mild BDR to no DR was associated with lower SBP and lower HbA1c .

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

Main complaint: Decrease of visual acuity (OS>OD).
Ocular medical history: at OS central scotoma since two weeks.
General medical history: Bone marrow biopsy showing chronic myelogenous leukemia. The laboratory evaluation depicting white blood cell count of 620.000. Chemotherapy was initiated.
Methods: Color photography, SD-OCT (HE, Germany).
Findings:
(1) Fundoscopic examination of OS: optic disc edema, retinal venous tortuousity and dilatation, retinal blot and flame-shaped hemorrhages, Roth spots.
(2) SD-OCT of optic nerve head, OS: optic disc edema.
(3) SD-OCT of macula: central and peripheral infiltrates. 
Discussion:
Retinopathy in Chronic Myeloic Leukemia („Fundus leucaemicus“) is often associated with reduction of visual acuity. The ocular manifestations are unspecific, but characteristic for severe systemic diseases. Color fundus photograph show marked venous dilatation and tortuosity, cotton wool spots, and multiple retinal, preretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots. Large whitish retinal masses present temporally with satellite lesions at the posterior border are suggestive of retinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is helpful for quantification of the pathological retinal changes. Peripheral blood counts and differential haemograms are seminal for the diagnosis of CML. First line therapy for CML is the application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Glivec). Ophthalmological adverse effects of this therapy, such as periorbital edema, are possible (1,2) .

Discussion: Preeclampsia is one of the leading causes of perinatal and maternal mortality and morbidity across the world. This condition complicates approximately 3% to 7% of pregnancies, and the severe form affects 0.6% to 1.2% of pregnancies. Preeclampsia can cause grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy with hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, hard exudates in the macular region, and swelling of the optic disks. The severe preeclampsia variant, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), occurs in approximately 20-25% of women with severe preeclampsia . It is named not only for the liver involvement but also for the disorder of the coagulation system which develops. Approximately 20% of women with HELLP syndrome develop disseminated intravascular coagulation, which carries a poor prognosis for both mother and fetus. Conditions other than preeclampsia can cause serous retinal detachments and choroidal thickening. Central serous retinopathy is hypothesized to be due to an overactivation of mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in the choroidal vasculature.

Patient: 13 years of age, male, BCVA 1.0 at OD, 0.6 at OS.
Ocular Medical History: Young boy projected a handheld green laser pointer (532 nm green laser light, power < 5 mW, Class III Laser) through a window at the street. The reflected light from the glass leaded to a bilateral exposure of the macula. Two months later without any systemic therapy we found an instrinsic repair. 
General Medical History: empty.
Main Complant: decreased vision after exposure to a green laser pointer.
Purpose: to present instrinsic repair of Laser pointer maculopathy. 
Methods: Colour Image Posterior Pole, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography  OCT, Fluorescein angiography FFA
Findings:
Colour Image Posterior Pole: just after laser exposure yellowish round spot in the foveal area.
Colour Image Posterior Pole: two months after laser exposure partial resolution yellowish round spot, persistent alterations at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium.
OCT: just after laser exposure disruption of the external limiting membrane, impairment of photoreceptor zone of the inner segments, and interdigitation zone.
OCT: two months after laser exposure partial resolution of the outer retinal disruption compared to initial visit with persistent, small foveal photoreceptor defects, residual disruption of the outer retinal layer at the fovea remained unchanged.
FFA: two months after laser exposure increased central avascular zone, late ill-defined leakage. 
Discussion: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 4 major classes of lasers (I–IV), of which the laser pointers belong to class IIIA (1). Diode laser pointers of red–orange (633–650 nm wavelength) are safer than the green–blue (400–500 nm). Injuries to the eye can occur within few seconds when the exposed to class III lasers that emit up to 5 mW power. Hossein et al.

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm. 
Symptomatic choroidal metastases is a rare presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Choroidal metastases (CM) are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. CM is detected in 2% to 7% of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is generally discovered at the end-stage of the disease. Singh et al. (2) reported the demographic profile, histology, disease stage, ocular and lung lesions, diagnostic and treatment (systemic and ocular) modalities, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer : 67% of patients were male and 78% were current or ex-smokers, mean age was 55 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type followed by squamous and small cell. Bilateral involvement was rare (<10%). Ocular treatment modalities included radiation, enucleation, and systemic steroids. Regression of choroidal metastases with treatment was observed in 67% of patients who did not undergo enucleation.

Main Complaint: reduction of VA in OS.
Findings:
1) Colour Photography: bilateral optic nerve atrophy (OS>OD).
2) VEP: decreased amplitudes und prolonged latencies.
3) OCT: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.
Discussion:
It was reported (1,2), that antibiotic therapy with Linezolid (Zyvoxid®) can cause optic nerve atrophy. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, used against infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may lead to progressive, potentially irreversible neuropathies of the optic nerve especially in long-time application.
Linezolid is part of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal initiation complex. Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

Discussion:
Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS ) has been considered an inflammatory disease of the RPE or deep retina . MEWDS is an acute, usually unilateral  chorioretinopathy with varying degrees of retinal and choroidal involvement and with multiple yellow or white spots in the fundus. Patients report blurred vision, photopsia, or visual field defects. The cause is unknown.  Hyperfluorescence in fluorescein angiography was interpreted to be hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris. Li et al. (1) followed seven patients with unilateral MEWDS. He found during 1.5 weeks to 6 months follow-up, the BCVA returned to 1.0 along with resolution of the white dots in all patients.

Discussion:
Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS ) has been considered an inflammatory disease of the RPE or deep retina . MEWDS is an acute, usually unilateral  chorioretinopathy with varying degrees of retinal and choroidal involvement and with multiple yellow or white spots in the fundus. Patients report blurred vision, photopsia, or visual field defects. The cause is unknown.  Hyperfluorescence in fluorescein angiography was interpreted to be hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris. Li et al. (1) followed seven patients with unilateral MEWDS. He found during 1.5 weeks to 6 months follow-up, the BCVA returned to 1.0 along with resolution of the white dots in all patients.

Patient: 74 years of age, female, BCVA  0.7 at OD, 0.8 at OS, IOP OD 17 mmHg, OS 15 mmHg, pachymetry  OD 560µm, OS 566µm. 
General Medical History: empty.
Ocular Medical History: no visual problems, routine checkup to rule out glaucoma.
Main Complaint: no complaints.
PURPOSE:  To describe a peripapillary and macular retinoschisis, only visible by OCT.
Methods: Colour fundus photography, w-w-perimetry (Octopus G1), fluorescein angiography (HRA, Heidelberg Engineering),  SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering).
Colour fundus photography: no glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy, no epiretinal gliosis.
W-w-perimetry : peripheral scotoma.
Frequency Doubling Technique FDT: paracentral scotoma.
OCT: large peripapillary retinoschisis, including the macular area,  mimicking a true retinoschisis cavity, although bridging retinal elements were identifiable. Cavity within cup suggests optic pit (arrow). No evidence of choroidal neovascular membrane.
Fluorescein Angiography : showing minor  leakage on fluorescein angiography within the optic disk (arrow), indicating location of the cavity. No evidence of choroidal neovascular membrane.

Discussion: 
The etiology of the peripapillary and macular retinoschisis is uncertain. There was no history of acute rises in IOP. A congenital optic pit could not be found by ophthalmoscopy. We hypothesized that there might be a communicating bridge connecting the cavity within the optic nerve head and the peripapillary  retinoschisis, which was found in  the fluorescein angiography .  Zumbro et al  (1) hypothesized that fluctuations in IOP played a role in vitreous traction and the development of retinoschisis. They supposed that acute elevations in IOP may have led to small changes in axial length or severe optic nerve cupping that allowed vitreous to enter the retina. As there were no severe fluctuations in IOP of our case, but a minor leakage in the optic cup was observed, we believe that the retinoretinoschisis is the result of a structural defect in the optic nerve in the optic disk. Microholes in the thinning and structural defects areas in the optic cup allowed liquid vitreous to enter the retina via the nerve fiber layer. The fluid caused retinal edema, followed by  a retinoschisis. Macular and peripapillary retinoschisis can occur in patients with presumed enlarged optic nerve head cups in the absence of obvious congenital anomalies of the disk. We believe the cause is leakage of fluid through a tiny hole in the thin tissue of the cup. This is a similar mechanism to that seen in patients with optic pits

Patient: 57 years of age, female,  autorefraction OD -2.5-0.25/180°, OS -2.75-0.25/5°, BCVA 1.0 at OD, 1.0 at OS, IOP RA 14 mmHg, IOP LA 14 mmHg, pachymetry OD 547 µm, OS 546 µm.
General Medical History: Hashimoto thyreoditis.
Ocular Medical History: in 2005 parapapillary bleedings with regular visual fields, the 24h-IOP profiles were always 14-16 mmHg at OD and OS without any therapy, there was a regular cerebral MRI . 
Main complaint: parapapillary bleedings.
Purpose: to show transition from pre-perimetric to perimetric glaucoma  with a clear glaucomatous change in the optic nerve head over an interval of 7 years  from 2006 to 2013.
Methods: Fundus Colour Image, w-w-Perimetry  30° Octopus G1, SD-OCT Heidelberg Engineering.
Findings:
Colour fundus imaging: showing a structural progression of the optic nerve head over 7 years  from 2006 to 2013, depicting in 2013 a parapapillary hemorrhage at 11h with minor changes in the retinal pigment epithelium.
Visual field : showing minor changes in the visual fields from 2006 to 2007, and in 2008 a clear scotoma. Over 7 years there was a mean loss of 1,2 dB/year and a functional defect of -8.7% per year with an acceleration in the last 3 years.
SD-OCT: showing in 2008 a localized  defect at 7h, in 2013 a general atrophy and a deep defect at 7h of the retinal fiber layer. The retinal nerve fiber layer showed a decrease from 79 µm to 65 µma over 6 years.

Dicussion: 
In POAG the loss of neuroretinal rim area per year could be very small. Mardin  (1) described, that a  glaucoma induced rim loss is very small per year and should be differentiated from regular age-related loss. The most pronounced loss in glaucoma  is temporal, both superior and inferior. Bengtsson et al (2) examined distributions of rates of progression from visual field series in pseudophakic eyes by Octopus perimeter (Haag Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland). They found in glaucoma patients a mean loss of 2.7%/year with the mean defect index MDI.

Discussion:
Nodular scleritis can present as isolated condition or as part of a systemic inflammatory or infectious disorder. It is a serious ocular condition that can result in vision loss. Two-thirds of patients with non-infectious scleritis require systemic glucocorticoid therapy, and one fourth need a glucocorticoid-sparing agent, as well. Jabs et al (1) reported  in a retrospective study of 97 patients with scleritis, that 30% required nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone, 31% required oral glucocorticoids, and 26% required immunosuppressive drugs in addition to glucocorticoids to control their disease. Nodular anterior scleritis responded more often to NSAIDs (57%), whereas necrotizing scleritis often required systemic immunosuppressive drugs (70%).  Scleritis can occur in any age group but usually presents between ages 30 and 50  and women are affected approximately twice more often than men. There is no racial or geographic predilection. There is no known HLA association. The prevalence of scleritis in the general population is estimated to be 6 cases per 100,000 people. It has been described up to 7% of those with Wegener’s granulomatosis. Fong et al (2) discussed the pathogenesis of scleritis. They found that  the data available support an important  role for T cells in the inflammatory process. Inflammatory cells, mostly T cells and macrophages, are found on biopsy specimens.

Discussion
Differentiating ischemic CRVO from nonischemic CRVO is crucial. Fluorescein fundus angiography during the early acute phase of CRVO provided reliable information about retinal capillary nonperfusion in approximately 60% of cases.  Visual outcome is good in nonischemic CRVO and poor in ischemic CRVO. Hayreh (1) suggested, that a clear differentiation of CRVO into nonischemic and ischemic types, based primarily on functional criteria, is fundamental in determining visual outcome. He reported that visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 78% with nonischemic CRVO and in only 1% with ischemic CRVO. Final visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 83% with nonischemic CRVO and in only 12% with ischemic CRVO. Of 100% eyes with nonischemic CRVO, about 10% converted to the ischemic type. Hayreh reported, that there was a higher prevalence of history of cerebrovascular disease in those that converted from nonischemic to ischemic CRVO. Most CRVO eyes start as nonischemic and some convert later to ischemic CRVO.

Slit lamp photo showing counterclockwise rotation of the superonasal segment (red arrows) which appear to push the tip of the inferotemporal segment into the optical zone (white arrow). 

Patient: Female subject, 49 years old, preoperative best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) 20/60 in left eye. 
Ocular Medical History: The patient was unable to tolerate rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens and chose ICRS implantation to improve vision. Intrastromal corneal ring segment (ICRS) implantation was performed. Major surgical procedures: Two 0.45 mm ICRS were implanted (Intacs, Addition Technology, Inc., Des Plaines, IL). The corneal channels were created with a femtosecond laser (iFS, Abbott Medical Optics Inc., Santa Ana, CA). The channel depth was set at 356 microns, 70% of the average pachymetry within the 6-9mm diameter zone (Orbscan II). A single 10-0 nylon suture was used to close the wound. One day after surgery, the BSCVA was improved. On the one month follow-up, the patient complained of eye irritation. To prevent further dissection into the optical zone, both segments were explanted. 

Main Complaint:T After surgery patient complained decreased visual acuity in both eyes without pain. 
Purpose: To report a case of unusual complication of ring segments migrated infranasally after 
Methods:Colour Image, optical coherence tomography (OCT, RTVue, Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA), Orbscan II.
Findings: 
Preoperative Findings:
Scanning-slit tomography/topography (Orbscan II, Bausch & Lomb, Rochester, NY) showed moderate inferior steepening. 
Optical coherence tomography (OCT, RTVue, Optovue Inc. Fremont, CA): central pachymetry 429 µm
Orbscan II: showing average corneal thickness within 6-9 mm annual zone of 509 µm with minimum 486 µm. 

Postoperative Findings: 
One day after surgery
BSCVA: improving to 20/40. 
Slit lamp: showing ring segments in proper position. 

On the one month follow-up:
BSCVA: patient complained of eye irritation, BSCVA was 20/40-1.  
Slit lamp: showing both ring segments migrated infranasally, causing the tips to overlap.  At the point of overlap the intrastromal channels were widened and the tip of the inferotemporal segment had migrated centrally into the optical zone (Figure 1, 2). No edema or infiltration was observed.  
OCT: showing that both segments remained within the lamellar plane of the channel, and the relative depth of ring segments was 76% as measured at the inner edge (Figure 3). 

One day after removing the ICRS segment:
BSCVA: VA was 20/40+1.
Slit Lamp: The cornea had returned to its preoperative appearance except for faint haze in the ICRS channel.
 
Discussion: 
One of the most common complications of ICRS implantation is ring segment displacement. Two previous studies reported the complications after mechanical channel creation.  Kanellopoulos et al reported in 2006 six out of 20 keratoconus cases (30%) had ring segments movement about 3-6 months postoperatively.1 Such high incidence was not reported in other studies. Zare et al reported in 2007 ring segments displacement occurred in three out of 30 keratoconus cases (10%)  3-5 months after ICRS implantation.2 The reported incidence of ring segment migration with femtosecond laser channel creation was much lower. Coskunseven et al reported in 2011 that among 850 eyes, ring segment movement was observed in 11 (1.3%) cases at 2 months postoperatively.3 In these reported cases of ring migration, the movement was within the surgically created channel or incisional wound, or associated with corneal thinning and melting superficial to the segments,1,2 or protrusion through the Descemet’s membrane, 4 or even perforation into the anterior chamber.5 Dissection through the lateral wall of the channel had not been explicitly described. 
In our case, dissection of the ring segments in the corneal stromal happened one month after ICRS implantation, which is earlier than the range of 2-6 months reported in previous studies.2,3,6 There was intra-channel rotation of one segment while the other segment dissection along the lamellar plane of the channel toward the optical zone, which had not been reported before.  Several factors could have contributed to this pattern of dissection.  One is the thickness of the segments.  The 450 µm thick segments that was used was the maximum available, and only recently approved by the FDA for use in the US.  The thicker segment and overlapping tip could have created greater stress to split the cornea along the lamellar plane.  Another factor was the 76% depth.   Inter-lamellar corneal fibers decrease posteriorly and therefore deeper lamellar planes are easier to dissection.  Another factor was the relatively advanced nature of keratoconus in this case, with only 429 µm corneal thickness centrally.  Although this is above the 400 µm minimum needed to qualify for Intacs, it is thinner than most cases of ICRS implantation.5,7 
In conclusion, thick ICRS segments, deep implantation depth, and thin cornea may be the risk factors for lateral dissection and migration of ICRS segments. This suggests that ICRS may be safer for less advanced cases of keratoconus.

Primary pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is a condition usually seen in younger myopic males that is characterized by radial defects of the iris pigment epithelium visible on retroillumination, with liberation and deposition of melanin granules on the corneal endothelium (Krukenberg spindle), on the posterior lens capsule, and in the trabecular meshwork and it is frequently associated with secondary open-angle glaucoma, and also referred to as pigmentary glaucoma, which is believed to be caused by melanin granules that, after being released from the iris pigment epithelium into the aqueous humor, lead to obstruction of the aqueous outflow pathways. The degree of retrocorneal Krukenberg spindle, are graded semiquantitatively by means of the following scale: not present, trace, mild, moderate, and marked. Extensive dispersion of melanin granules, sometimes associated with a marked rise of intraocular pressure, has been described after medical pupillary dilation

Discussion: Ocular coloboma is a common malformation. It includes a spectrum of anomalies that ranges from iris coloboma to clinical anophthalmos. Coloboma is etiologically heterogeneous. The spectrum  can vary from small colobomas located in the equatorial region that do not interfere with vision, to large colobomas involving the disc and macula with severe impairment of vision. Choroidal coloboma is a congenital defect caused by defective closure of embryonal fissure, which normally takes place during the 6th week of gestation. As an isolated defect, it is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs (1, 3). Gopal L et al. (2) described choroidal colobomas. Genetic as well as environmental causes have been proposed to cause an intrauterine insult that can lead to defective closure of the embryonal fissure leading to coloboma of the fundus (3). Histologically, the colobomatous area is deficient in normal choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and the retina.

Findings: 
02/2012: The nevus clinically appears as a brown pigmented lesion, presumedly composed of epithelial and subepithelial nests of benign melanocytic cells. 
05/2013: No changes in its appearance were noticed.
Discussion:
The caruncle is a nodular structure lying at the internal canthus, medial to the plica semilunaris. The caruncle is widely exposed in the palpebral aperture. Patients or physicians easily notice changes in its appearance. It was reported the types and incidence of caruncular lesions (1) of a total of 195 consecutive caruncular lesions from 191 patients. The most common type were nevi (47%) and papillomas (15%). They found that 94% were benign, 3% were premalignant, and 2.6% were malignant. It was concluded, that malignancy is clinically overestimated, and some malignant lesions can take a benign aspect, justifying close photographic follow-up of all lesions. Because caruncular malignant melanoma is associated with poor prognosis, pigmented lesions should be monitored carefully. In the absence of clear criteria for malignancy, any change in color, size, or vascularization of a caruncular lesion should hasten excision.

Discussion:
Spontaneous hyphema refers to a nontraumatic hemorrhage in the anterior chamber and may result from such conditions as rubeosis iridis, intraocular neoplasms, blood dyscrasias, severe iritis, fibrovascular membranes in the retrolental or zonular area, and vascular anomalies of the iris. Terry et al. (1) presented  a case with a spontaneous hyphema occurring as a result of iris neovascularization in a patient who suffered from occlusion of the central retinal vein.

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

Discussion: Iris melanocytoma is a rare variant of iris nevus with typical clinical features. Although the tumor is benign, it can spread to the surrounding structures, causing glaucoma and giving an erroneous impression of melanoma.  Iris melanocytoma presents as a darkly-pigmented iris nodule with mossy, irregular surface. Iris melanocytoma usually has been considered to be a relatively stationary lesion. Demirci et al. (1) found that growth occurred in 23% of the patients at 5 years and 48% at 10 years.

Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

Purpose: to present optic pit in glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, Optical Coherence Tomography, Visual Field.
Findings:

Optical Coherence Tomography at 7 o’clock: yellow line indicates the scanned optical coherence tomography (OCT) lines, B-scan image illustrates the hyporeflective space (arrowhead) at the location of optic disc pit. 
Optical Coherence Tomography at 8 o‘clock: yellow line indicates the scanned optical coherence tomography (OCT) lines, B-scan image shows no hyporeflective space indicating an optic disc pit. 
OCT Circular Scan: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness RNFL at the inferotemporal sector.
Visual Field: parafoveal scotoma in the superior hemifield corresponding to the decreased RNFL thickness at the inferotemporal sector. 
Discussion: 
Choi et al. (1) reported that optic disc pits had a diverse structure according to the alteration of the lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue. Optic disc pit is often associated with a corresponding scotoma. Choi et al. (1) suggested, that a compliant lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue may become susceptible to the damaging effects of increased IOP values. The ongoing insult to the optic nerve may then influence the lamina cribrosa tissue or prelaminar tissue, exhibiting the appearance of alteration in the lamina cribrosa or or prelaminar tissue. Subsequently, the axons passing through the altered lamina cribrosa and or prelaminar tissue are likely to be damaged by loss of structural support, loss of nutrient supply from laminar capillaries, or loss of metabolic support from astrocytes.

Discussion:
Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked retinal dystrophy belonging to the family of blinding disorders. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. CHM is caused by mutations in the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1) gene, which encodes a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (1). Complete deletion of the CHM gene causes severe choroideremia. Mura et al. (2) presented results of serial ERGs documenting progression first of rod and then of cone disease.

Discussion:
Disc areas lower or equal 1.5 mm2 were defined as small discs. The detection of glaucoma focusses on the evaluation of morphometric changes in the optic nerve. Such abnormalities include changes in the optic disc area, cup area, and neuroretinal rim volume and retinal nerve fiber layer thickness. Assessment of the optic disc size is an essential component. Eyes with smaller discs might induce higher risks for developing and processing glaucomatous damage due to fewer optic nerve fibers and a smaller anatomic reserve capacity. Optic nerve fiber count correlates with optic disc area. (1)

Discussion:
Arteritis temporalis shows a variable course of the disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss. Hayeh et al. (1) reported, that patients with giant cell arteritis presented a variety of ocular symptoms : visual loss of varying severity in 98%, amaurosis fugax in 31%, diplopia in 6%, and eye pain in 8%. Because giant cell arteritis is a potentially blinding disease and its early diagnosis is the key to preventing blindness, it is important to recognize its various ocular manifestations. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ infarction (2).

Discussion:
Before establishing the RP diagnosis, it was essential to rule out other possible etiologies such as trauma, infection, inflammation, and cancer. Our case did not presented traumatic history of the head or eye. Our workup ruled out infectious diseases, such as Lyme disease, bartonellosis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, and viral infections. Inflammatory diseases were ruled out. Farrell (1) examined a total of 272 cases of retinitis pigmentosa and 167 cases of cone-rod dystrophy. He found that the percentage of familial and nonfamilial cases was the same for the bilateral and unilateral forms of the disease. In his series, unilateral retinitis pigmentosa makes up approximately 5% of the total population of retinitis pigmentosa. He said, that in the familial forms of unilateral retinitis pigmentosa the most common inheritance pattern was autosomal dominant and all affected relatives had bilateral disease.
The genetic mechanisms which account for asymmetric disorders are not currently understood. It may be a different unidentified mutation at a single loci or it is possible that nonlinked mutations in multiple loci account for this unusual disorder. Marsiglia  et al. (2) proposed 2 genetic mechanisms that could explain the unusual unilateral presentation of RP: mosaicism and somatic mutations. Both mechanisms may cause asymmetric and partial involvement of a genetic disease throughout the body.

He found that the percentage of familial and nonfamilial cases was the same for the bilateral and unilateral forms of the disease. In his series, unilateral retinitis pigmentosa makes up approximately 5% of the total population of retinitis pigmentosa. He said, that in the familial forms of unilateral retinitis pigmentosa the most common inheritance pattern was autosomal dominant and all affected relatives had bilateral disease.
The genetic mechanisms which account for asymmetric disorders are not currently understood. It may be a different unidentified mutation at a single loci or it is possible that nonlinked mutations in multiple loci account for this unusual disorder. Marsiglia  et al.

Discussion:
Before establishing the RP diagnosis, it was essential to rule out other possible etiologies such as trauma, infection, inflammation, and cancer.

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

Only slight perifocal edema. The maximal extent is 68 x 43 x 58 mm. In summary, this lesion is most likely a central neurocytoma.
Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

Discussion: 
Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy characterized by retinal ganglion cells (RGC) loss and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) injury. Medeiros FA et al. (1) showed, that glaucomatous eyes had an average retinal ganglion cells loss of 28%, ranging from 6% to 57%, at the time of the earliest visual field defect on standard automated perimetry (SAP) visual fields. Glaucomatous eyes with the earliest detectable visual field loss on automated perimetry may already show substantial loss of retinal ganglion cells.

Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

Methods: Colour photography.
Findings:
Colour Image: The anterior pyramidal opacity consisted of hyperplastic lens epithelium, surrounded by a collagenous matrix.
Discussion:
Pyramidal anterior polar cataracts consist of hyperplastic lens epithelium in a collagenous matrix. They are present at birth and may represent a variant of anterior polar lens opacities. Anterior polar cataracts may be unilateral or, if bilateral, they may be either symmetric or asymmetric. Patients with pyramidal cataracts are likely to develop amblyopia. All infants and young children with anterior polar opacities showing this configuration should be followed for cataract progression and amblyopia.
It was reported (1, 2) that, over one-third of the patients with congenital anterior polar cataracts were found to have strabismus, refractive anisometropia, or some form of amblyopia. These findings suggest a less benign prognosis for congenital anterior polar cataracts. It was recommended regular follow-up of all children with anterior cataracts until a secure assessment of vision can be made.

Findings:
Colour Image: The anterior pyramidal opacity consisted of hyperplastic lens epithelium, surrounded by a collagenous matrix.
Discussion:
Pyramidal anterior polar cataracts consist of hyperplastic lens epithelium in a collagenous matrix. They are present at birth and may represent a variant of anterior polar lens opacities. Anterior polar cataracts may be unilateral or, if bilateral, they may be either symmetric or asymmetric. Patients with pyramidal cataracts are likely to develop amblyopia. All infants and young children with anterior polar opacities showing this configuration should be followed for cataract progression and amblyopia.
It was reported (1, 2) that, over one-third of the patients with congenital anterior polar cataracts were found to have strabismus, refractive anisometropia, or some form of amblyopia. These findings suggest a less benign prognosis for congenital anterior polar cataracts. It was recommended regular follow-up of all children with anterior cataracts until a secure assessment of vision can be made.

Findings: 
(1) OS: Retinal microinfarct during therapy with Interferon beta
(2) OS: Regular retina, 4 months after finishing therapy with Interferon beta
Discussion:
Interferons are natural glycoproteins and have antiviral, anti-proliferative and immune regulatory functions. There are several classes including interferon alpha, beta and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are used in the treatment of several diseases including hepatitis C, cancer and immune-mediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Nearly 500 cases of ophthalmological complications related to interferon have been reported (1). The main ophthalmological complication from interferon treatment is essentially a vascular retinopathy  with soft exudates, hemorrhages or retinal ischemia. Hayasaka et al. (2) reported that systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus were clear risk factors for eye disease during therapy with interferons. Frequent exposure to interferon may induce the production of autoantibodies leading to the deposition of immune complexes in the retina or retinal vessels (3).

If overaction is present, it will be seen both on duction testing in the direction of the primary action of the oblique muscle in question and also as a hypertropia in horizontal gaze. In this patient, the V-pattern is felt to be secondary to inferior oblique muscle overaction, which is acting primarily as an abductor in upgaze, causing the eyes to diverge more than in downgaze.

Findimgs:
(1) Colour photography: Colour image reveals a corneal opening, a flat anterior chamber, an iris injury, and a rupture of the crystalline lens.
(2) Cranial Computer Tomography: CCT showed an intraocular foreign body (arrow). 

Discussion:  Work-related injuries can cause significant morbidity in a young population of patients. Occupational injuries are common. In 2004 in the United States there were 1.3 million injuries that resulted in at least 1 day of missed work. Of these work-related injuries, 36 680 involved the eye. The lifetime prevalence of work-related eye injuries among US workers is 4.4% (1). Bauza et al. (2) analyzed the clinical characteristics of a total of 183 eyes with work-related open globe injuries. He found that the majority of injuries occurred in men (96.7%), and the most common cause was nail gun use (47.0%). Intraocular foreign bodies were found in 21%. Presenting visual acuity (VA) was worse than 20/200 in 66% and no light perception in 6%. Final visual acuity worse than 20/200 occurred in 37%.

General Medical History: empty.
Ocular Medical History: injury of the eye during work.
Main complaint: sudden loss of vision and pain.
Methods: Colour photography, cranial Computer Tomography.
Findimgs:
(1) Colour photography: Colour image reveals a corneal opening, a flat anterior chamber, an iris injury, and a rupture of the crystalline lens.
(2) Cranial Computer Tomography: CCT showed an intraocular foreign body (arrow). 

Discussion:  Work-related injuries can cause significant morbidity in a young population of patients. Occupational injuries are common. In 2004 in the United States there were 1.3 million injuries that resulted in at least 1 day of missed work. Of these work-related injuries, 36 680 involved the eye. The lifetime prevalence of work-related eye injuries among US workers is 4.4% (1). Bauza et al. (2) analyzed the clinical characteristics of a total of 183 eyes with work-related open globe injuries. He found that the majority of injuries occurred in men (96.7%), and the most common cause was nail gun use (47.0%). Intraocular foreign bodies were found in 21%. Presenting visual acuity (VA) was worse than 20/200 in 66% and no light perception in 6%. Final visual acuity worse than 20/200 occurred in 37%. Significant prognostic factors for a final visual acuity of no light perception were rupture injury, and initial visual acuity of no light perception.

Seidel test was negative. 
The applied type of corneoscleral incision usually leads to loosening of the sutures because the suture is not covered by conjunctival tissue like it would be with a fornix-based flap. The soft conjunctiva gives in and the suture loosenes. Slight pressure on the cornea would make the Seidel-test positive. The sutures hold well on Bowman's membrane but they loosen on the scleral side. Alternative options would  have been  a truly corneal incision or a fornix- or limbus-based conjunctival flap over a sclerocorneal incision.
Advice for present situation: Woundrevision , 2-3 situation sutures, fornix-based conjunctival flap; cleaning of wound (presumably there is a vitreous strand which reaches from the peaked pupil to the periphery at 11 o'clock with damaged iris); 5 10-0-Nylon sutures  broad in sclera and cornea and then 2 traction sutures to cover the wound with conjunctival flap.",#Optho::Lens::PostoperativeCasesandSurgicalProcedures,"<img src=""7848.jpg"">"

The uveitis is usually bilateral, nongranulomatous, limited to the anterior segment. TINU generally responds well to topical or oral anti-inflammatory treatment. Johnson et al. (1) suggested, that TINU syndrome as an under-recognized disorder may account for some cases of uveitis otherwise characterized as 'idiopathic."" The uveitis may be the presenting sign in up to 36% of cases of TINU syndrome. Prompt detection through referral or testing will allow speedy diagnosis and appropriate treatment for both the uveitis and the tubulointerstitial nephritis. The cause of the disease is still unknown. A hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, especially an infection is thought to trigger the disease. Mackensen  et al. (2) showed  advances in diagnostics. Beta-2 microglobulin (Ub2MG) analysis in urine and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is helpful to diagnose TINU cases. A high association of HLA-DRB1*01 has been shown with TINU.

The uveitis may be the presenting sign in up to 36% of cases of TINU syndrome. Prompt detection through referral or testing will allow speedy diagnosis and appropriate treatment for both the uveitis and the tubulointerstitial nephritis. The cause of the disease is still unknown. A hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, especially an infection is thought to trigger the disease. Mackensen  et al. (2) showed  advances in diagnostics. Beta-2 microglobulin (Ub2MG) analysis in urine and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing is helpful to diagnose TINU cases. A high association of HLA-DRB1*01 has been shown with TINU.

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

Discussion: 
Optic nerve head drusen are calcific deposits buried or at the surface of the optic disc. Nentwich et al. reported (1) that drusen of the optic disc occur in 0.34 to 2.4 % of human individuals. Within histological sections drusen are found six times more often than on funduscopic examination. Diagnostic tools include fundus-autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography and ultrasound. Fundus Autofluorescence  shows inherent autofluorescent properties of optic nerve head drusen. Drusen of the optic nerve head can lead to transient visual impairment, and to profound visual field defects in adulthood. The mechanism of drusen-related field loss is poorly understood. Tso (2) proposed that disc drusen are a consequence of abnormal axonal metabolism leading to the deposition of calcium crystals in mitochondria and disruption of axons with further accumulation of calcified cellular contents.

___Discussion:  In presented case the increased foveolar avascular zone and the rarefication of macular capillaries  in OD may be caused by the venous vascular dysregulation, and glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy. Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy with optic nerve deterioration, visual field defects, and vascular dysregulation and rarefication. Müller et al. and Zivkovicet al. investigated macular capillaries in glaucoma by OCT-angiography. Zivkovic M et al. (2) measured foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in NTG and healthy subjects. He reported that mean horizontal, mean vertical diameter, and FAZ area were significantly enlarged in the NTG group. Müller et al.

Discussion: 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause after diabetic retinopathy of vision loss due to retinal vascular disease. Branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is about 3-6 times more common than central vein occlusion (CRVO). Ho et al. (1) reported, that pooled data showed prevalence rates of about 0.52% for any RVO, 0.44% for BRVO, and 0.08% for CRVO. BRVO is caused by a combination of vein compression at arteriovenous crossings, degenerative changes within venous walls, and hypercoagulability. 34% of nonischemic retinal vein occlusion converted to the ischemic type. Kokolaki et al. (2) showed, that collateral vessels developed in 60% of patients 6±3 months after diagnosis.

Thygeson's superficial punctate keratitis (TSPK) is a chronic disease with exacerbations and remissions over years. Hallmarks include multiple, whitish-gray, intraepithelial corneal lesions with minimal conjunctival involvement. Etiology is controversial. Thygeson's superficial punctate keratitis has a genetic association with HLA-DR3, an antigen associated with immunogenic responses. Treatment consists of artificial tears, corticosteroids, topical cyclosporine, or soft contact lenses.

Discussion
Fuchs' corneal dystrophy - a dominantly inherited disorder -  is a slowly progressive, bilateral corneal dystrophy that affects corneal endothelial cells. 
Cataract surgery is a risk factor for corneal endothelial cell loss. Corneal endothelial cell loss, a major complication that sometimes occurs after cataract surgery, can lead to corneal edema and decompensation if cell density falls to 500 cells/mm2 or below. Yamazoe et al (1) reported that the mean rate of endothelial cell loss is about 12% ± 23%.  Seitzman  et al (2) reported a series of patients with Fuchs' dystrophy (136 eyes) undergoing cataract surgery. The average preoperative corneal thickness ranged from 482 to 674 µm. 37% had preoperative corneal thickness of 600 µm or thicker. Of eyes with preoperative pachymetry measurements of 600 µm or thicker, 10% progressed to penetrating keratoplasty. Patients with a preoperative corneal thickness of >640 μm had a 22.2% rate of requiring a corneal transplant. Their data suggest that current cataract removal techniques allow for excellent visual rehabilitation in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy who have a preoperative corneal thickness lower than 600 µm. They recommend a concurrent penetrating keratoplasty with cataract surgery in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy and a corneal thickness of >640 μm.

Blunt trauma to eye can cause a post vitreous detachment and the scar as presented in this case. Blunt trauma can also cause a retinal detachment and retina tears.

The most critical concern with blunt trauma to the eye is the possibility for retinal detachment.

Discussion:
Before establishing the RP diagnosis, it was essential to rule out other possible etiologies such as trauma, infection, inflammation, and cancer. Our case did not presented traumatic history of the head or eye. Our workup ruled out infectious diseases, such as Lyme disease, bartonellosis, toxocariasis, toxoplasmosis, and viral infections. Inflammatory diseases were ruled out. Farrell (1) examined a total of 272 cases of retinitis pigmentosa and 167 cases of cone-rod dystrophy. He found that the percentage of familial and nonfamilial cases was the same for the bilateral and unilateral forms of the disease. In his series, unilateral retinitis pigmentosa makes up approximately 5% of the total population of retinitis pigmentosa. He said, that in the familial forms of unilateral retinitis pigmentosa the most common inheritance pattern was autosomal dominant and all affected relatives had bilateral disease.
The genetic mechanisms which account for asymmetric disorders are not currently understood. It may be a different unidentified mutation at a single loci or it is possible that nonlinked mutations in multiple loci account for this unusual disorder. Marsiglia  et al. (2) proposed 2 genetic mechanisms that could explain the unusual unilateral presentation of RP: mosaicism and somatic mutations. Both mechanisms may cause asymmetric and partial involvement of a genetic disease throughout the body.

The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of disorders characterised by accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) within a wide variety of tissues, including those of the eye. The MPS have been subdivided into different types depending on clinical manifestations. They encompass a wide spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from those disorders, which are fatal in the first months of life to those compatible with a normal lifespan. The MPS result from inherited abnormalities of specific lysosomal enzymes involved in degradation of GAG. Mucopolysaccharidoses type I (MPS I) is caused by abnormalities of the enzyme a -L-iduronidase. Ocular hypertension and glaucoma occur in MPS due to GAG acumulation within anterior chamber structures. This can lead to narrowing of the anterior chamber angle, and deposition within trabecular cells may lead to obstruction of outflow. MPS IH Hurler syndrome presents with facial dysmorphism and respiratory disease in early life, and patients may be referred to the ophthalmologist once the diagnosis is already made for detection of associated corneal opacification. The prevalence of ocular complications in patients with MPS was retrospectively reported by Ashworth JL et al.(1). They found in MPS IH patients: in 79% visual acuity of less than 6/12 equivalent in their better eye, in 16% severe corneal opacification, in 16% optic atrophy, in 1% ocular hypertension.

The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of disorders characterised by accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAG) within a wide variety of tissues, including those of the eye. The MPS have been subdivided into different types depending on clinical manifestations. They encompass a wide spectrum of phenotypes, ranging from those disorders, which are fatal in the first months of life to those compatible with a normal lifespan. The MPS result from inherited abnormalities of specific lysosomal enzymes involved in degradation of GAG. Mucopolysaccharidoses type I (MPS I) is caused by abnormalities of the enzyme a -L-iduronidase. Ocular hypertension and glaucoma occur in MPS due to GAG acumulation within anterior chamber structures. This can lead to narrowing of the anterior chamber angle, and deposition within trabecular cells may lead to obstruction of outflow.

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

Discussion:
Corneal topography pattern recognition combined with quantitative diagnostic indices is useful for the screening of keratoconus (KC). KC is a noninflammatory progressive corneal disease characterized by localized conical protrusion, apical thinning, irregular astigmatism, and central scarring in the cornea. Keratoconus and other forms of corneal ectasias may be considered as a spectrum of primary corneal ectasia. The prevalence of KC is approximately one per 2,000 in the general population. Lim et al. (1) characterized keratoconus suspect (1) by corneal topography showing an area of central, inferior, or superior steepening combined with any of the following: oblique cylinder >1.5 diopters (D); steep keratometric curvature greater than 47 D, or central corneal thickness less than 500 μm, but without any slit-lamp findings.

Main Complaint: sudden loss of vision.
Purpose: to present perfused cilioretinal artery in  central retinal artery occlusion.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, FFA, OCT-Spectralis.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: retinal pallor typical of central retinal artery occlusion , no visible arteriolar embolus, red area in parafoveal area.
FFA, 10 s: no arterial filling in the area of central retinal artery, regular filling of the cilioretinal artery
FFA, 19 s: late retrograde filling of venous retinal vessels. 
OCT-Spectralis: segmental focal thickening with hyperreflectivity due to intraretinal edema, regular retinal thickness in area of patent cilioretinal artery.  
Discussion:
Retinal arterial occlusions (CRAO) occurs secondary to an emboli, which may originate from atheromatous plaques in the ascending aorta or carotid arteries, as well as calcified heart valves. Brown et al. (1) reviewed a series of 107 cases with central retinal artery occlusions (CRAO). 26% showed a  macular sparing owing to a patent cilioretinal artery. Patients with patent cilioretinal sparing regained variable degrees of visual acuity. CRAO without cilioretinal sparing rarely regained any useful vision.

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

Discussion: In general pits of the optic nerve head (OPD) are oval cavities or depressions in the optic disc. Itis a herniation of dysplastic retinal tissue into a collagen rich excavation extending into the subarachnoid space through a defect in the lamina cribrosa.  Pits of the optic nerve can appear as a localized pit-like invagination in the optic disc. They can be congenital or acquired. ODPs can remain clinically asymptomatic in many cases. In about 50% patients with ODPs develop optic disc pit related maculopathy with retinoschisis, atrophy of inner retinal layers, serous macular detachment and significant loss of vision. 1-2

Discussion
Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula (1). Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is increasingly performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was reported (2) that most of the patients who had undergone SelAH had homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects contralateral to the side of the surgery.

Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Discussion:
Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked retinal dystrophy belonging to the family of blinding disorders. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. CHM is caused by mutations in the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1) gene, which encodes a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (1). Complete deletion of the CHM gene causes severe choroideremia. Mura et al. (2) presented results of serial ERGs documenting progression first of rod and then of cone disease.

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

Fluorescein angiography: exudative AMD. 
Colour Fundusphotography: central atrophy and hyperpigmentation of retinal pigmentepithelium in 06/2013. 
Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

General Medical History: empty
Purpose: 
to show an intraocular mirror effect by the surface of the resting gas bubble for intraocular tamponade.
Findings:
Colour Photography: 10 days after surgery with intraoperative use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas the surface of the resting gas bubble produces a mirror (arrow), generating a second image of the optic nerve head (*). 
Discussion: 
Gas mixtures are often used in vitrectomy surgery to tamponade the retina. In 1973, Norton proposed the use of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas to provide a longer-acting gas bubble for intraocular tamponade. Pure SF6 gas expands to 1.9–2.0 times its original size because oxygen and nitrogen from the blood enter the gas bubble more rapidly than SF6 can leave the bubble. The most rapid expansion occurs over the first 6–8 hours, and maximal expansion is reached at around 24 hours. SF6 lasts in the eye for 10–14 days.

Discussion: 
Pseudoexfoliation (PEX) represents the most common identifiable cause of open-angle glaucoma and a leading cause of blindness worldwide. PEX syndrome is a genetically determined, generalized disease of the extracellular matrix leading to the progressive deposition of an abnormal fibrillar material in various intraocular and extraocular tissues including the trabecular meshwork. Schlötzer-Schrehardt (1) reported, that the PEX-specific fibrotic matrix process is a stress-induced elastosis. It is characterized by an excessive production and abnormal cross-linking of elastic microfibrils into fibrillar PEX aggregates. She showed, that co-modulating factors triggering this fibrotic process include elevated concentrations of fibrogenic growth factors, such as TGF-β1, reduced activity of proteolytic enzymes, subtle inflammatory processes and various external stress factors. Genetic studies identified a highly significant association between several polymorphisms in the LOXL1 (lysyl oxidase-like 1) gene with both PEX syndrome and PEX glaucoma.

General medical history:  HIV since 10 years,  systemic therapy  with truvada and isentress. 
Ocular medical history:  visual acuity not constant, varied within months from 0.4 to 0.8.
Main Complaints: varying visual  acuity. 
Methods:
 Colour Photography, VEP, OCT.
Findings:  
 Colour Photography: pale optic nerve head.
OCT: diminuished retinal nerve fiber  thickness.
VEP: prolonged latencies, regular amplitude.

Discussion:
Optic neuropathies in HIV patients are caused by a variety of pathologies including infectious, compressive and inflammatory processes. There is evidence that the optic nerves of HIV infected patients can undergo chronic degeneration resulting in axonal loss. The current widely accepted theory emphasises the key role of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the genesis of primary HIV optic neuropathy. The pathogenesis of neuronal damage has been ascribed to the combined effect of neurotoxic agents including viral proteins and neurotoxic factors released from activated microglia and macrophages. 
Mwanza et al. (1) found, that VEPs were abnormal in 57% and 42% of HIV infected patients with and without neurological symptoms. HIV positive patients with neurological symptoms are not at higher risk for optic nerve damage than those without neurological manifestations. This support the hypothesis according to which axonal loss of the optic nerve is a common process occurring in all HIV infected subjects. 
There is evidence suggesting that, despite normal visual acuity, HIV infected subjects may have subclinical dysfunction of the optic nerves/retrochiasmal visual pathways that can be detected using electrophysiological methods.
A loss of cortical neurons has been found in asymptomatic HIV positive subjects in early stages of the infection. These lesions as well as others affecting the retrogeniculate part of the visual pathways, especially the primary visual cortex, may result in delay in both cortical processing and signal generation and thus in VEP abnormalities.

General medical history:  HIV since 10 years,  systemic therapy  with truvada and isentress. 
Ocular medical history:  visual acuity not constant, varied within months from 0.4 to 0.8.
Main Complaints: varying visual  acuity. 
Methods:
 Colour Photography, VEP, OCT.
Findings:  
 Colour Photography: pale optic nerve head.
OCT: diminuished retinal nerve fiber  thickness.
VEP: prolonged latencies, regular amplitude.

Discussion:
Optic neuropathies in HIV patients are caused by a variety of pathologies including infectious, compressive and inflammatory processes. There is evidence that the optic nerves of HIV infected patients can undergo chronic degeneration resulting in axonal loss. The current widely accepted theory emphasises the key role of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the genesis of primary HIV optic neuropathy. The pathogenesis of neuronal damage has been ascribed to the combined effect of neurotoxic agents including viral proteins and neurotoxic factors released from activated microglia and macrophages. 
Mwanza et al. (1) found, that VEPs were abnormal in 57% and 42% of HIV infected patients with and without neurological symptoms. HIV positive patients with neurological symptoms are not at higher risk for optic nerve damage than those without neurological manifestations. This support the hypothesis according to which axonal loss of the optic nerve is a common process occurring in all HIV infected subjects. 
There is evidence suggesting that, despite normal visual acuity, HIV infected subjects may have subclinical dysfunction of the optic nerves/retrochiasmal visual pathways that can be detected using electrophysiological methods.
A loss of cortical neurons has been found in asymptomatic HIV positive subjects in early stages of the infection. These lesions as well as others affecting the retrogeniculate part of the visual pathways, especially the primary visual cortex, may result in delay in both cortical processing and signal generation and thus in VEP abnormalities.

Discussion: 
Rebecca L Thomas et al. (1) determined the prevalence and severity of diabetic retinopathy in a cross-sectional analysis of about 90.000 persons with diabetes. They found a prevalence of any DR and sight-threatening DR in type 2 diabetes of 30% and 3%, respectively. The presence of DR was strongly associated with increasing duration of diabetes and with insulin therapy. Stratton IM (2) combined the results from 2 consecutive years of photographic screening enabling  estimation of the risk of future development of sight threatening DR.  They found that  patients  with background DR in both eyes at both screenings, 11% per year progressed to sight threatening DR.

General medical history: Systemic therapy with Interferone beta due to multiple sklerosis over several months. Due to ocular problems the systemic therapy with Interferon beta was stopped.
Main complaint: vision deterioration since some weeks (OS<OD) 
Purpose:  to present retinal microinfarcts associated with systemic Interferone beta and improvement of the retina after stopping the systemic Interferone beta-therapy. 
Method: patient undergone examination of fundus photography during and after therapy with systemic Interferone beta.
Findings: 
(1) OS: Retinal microinfarct during therapy with Interferon beta
(2) OS: Regular retina, 4 months after finishing therapy with Interferon beta
Discussion:
Interferons are natural glycoproteins and have antiviral, anti-proliferative and immune regulatory functions. There are several classes including interferon alpha, beta and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are used in the treatment of several diseases including hepatitis C, cancer and immune-mediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Nearly 500 cases of ophthalmological complications related to interferon have been reported (1). The main ophthalmological complication from interferon treatment is essentially a vascular retinopathy  with soft exudates, hemorrhages or retinal ischemia. Hayasaka et al. (2) reported that systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus were clear risk factors for eye disease during therapy with interferons. Frequent exposure to interferon may induce the production of autoantibodies leading to the deposition of immune complexes in the retina or retinal vessels (3).

MRI: FLAIR sequences on the level of the midbrain / LGN demonstrating the gliotic defect (arrow) after partial temporal lobe resection (Taylor-resection), (*) extending into the very ventral part of the optic radiation (Meyer´s loop) 
Discussion
Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula (1). Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is increasingly performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was reported (2) that most of the patients who had undergone SelAH had homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects contralateral to the side of the surgery.

Main complaint: Decrease of visual acuity (OS>OD).
Ocular medical history: at OS central scotoma since two weeks.
General medical history: Bone marrow biopsy showing chronic myelogenous leukemia. The laboratory evaluation depicting white blood cell count of 620.000. Chemotherapy was initiated.
Methods: Color photography, SD-OCT (HE, Germany).
Findings:
(1) Fundoscopic examination of OS: optic disc edema, retinal venous tortuousity and dilatation, retinal blot and flame-shaped hemorrhages, Roth spots.
(2) SD-OCT of optic nerve head, OS: optic disc edema.
(3) SD-OCT of macula: central and peripheral infiltrates. 
Discussion:
Retinopathy in Chronic Myeloic Leukemia („Fundus leucaemicus“) is often associated with reduction of visual acuity. The ocular manifestations are unspecific, but characteristic for severe systemic diseases. Color fundus photograph show marked venous dilatation and tortuosity, cotton wool spots, and multiple retinal, preretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots. Large whitish retinal masses present temporally with satellite lesions at the posterior border are suggestive of retinal infiltrates. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is helpful for quantification of the pathological retinal changes. Peripheral blood counts and differential haemograms are seminal for the diagnosis of CML. First line therapy for CML is the application of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Glivec). Ophthalmological adverse effects of this therapy, such as periorbital edema, are possible (1,2) .

Patient: 46 years of age, female, BCVA 0.08 at OD, 1.0 at OS.
Ocular Medical History: acute onset of painless visual loss in her right eye.
General Medical History: arterial hypertension, no history of amaurosis fugax, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, or stroke.
Main Complaint: sudden loss of vision.
Purpose: to present perfused cilioretinal artery in  central retinal artery occlusion.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, FFA, OCT-Spectralis.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: retinal pallor typical of central retinal artery occlusion , no visible arteriolar embolus, red area in parafoveal area.
FFA, 10 s: no arterial filling in the area of central retinal artery, regular filling of the cilioretinal artery
FFA, 19 s: late retrograde filling of venous retinal vessels. 
OCT-Spectralis: segmental focal thickening with hyperreflectivity due to intraretinal edema, regular retinal thickness in area of patent cilioretinal artery.  
Discussion:
Retinal arterial occlusions (CRAO) occurs secondary to an emboli, which may originate from atheromatous plaques in the ascending aorta or carotid arteries, as well as calcified heart valves. Brown et al. (1) reviewed a series of 107 cases with central retinal artery occlusions (CRAO). 26% showed a  macular sparing owing to a patent cilioretinal artery. Patients with patent cilioretinal sparing regained variable degrees of visual acuity. CRAO without cilioretinal sparing rarely regained any useful vision.

Discussion:
Perfluorodecalin is a perfluorocarbon liquid used intraoperatively in retinal detachment repair. The clarity of perfluorocarbon liquids, with a refractive index is close to that of water. It is usually removed at the end of the procedure. However, residual amounts may be retained. Peyman et al. (1) reported, that perfluorocarbon liquids have been used to facilitate surgery in a wide variety of conditions, including proliferative vitreoretinopathy, giant retinal tears, drainage of suprachoroidal hemorrhages, diabetic traction, retinal detachments with a rhegmatogenous component, dislocated crystalline or intraocular lenses, and retinal detachment associated with choroidal coloboma. All perfluorocarbon liquids when used as tamponading agents can compress and disorganize the retina. This ""toxicity"" is a physical effect rather than chemical toxicity and depends upon the amount of perfluorocarbon liquid injected. Perfluorocarbon liquids are not tolerated in the anterior chamber, causing corneal edema within 2-3 days at the site of contact.

The OCT-image presents only a rest of an accumulation of fluid in the paracentral retina due to leakage from dilated capillaries. The visual acuity was 0.9. 

70 years of age, female, R/L secondary open angle glaucoma, cataract corticalis.
A cataract surgery was performed in January 2010 without any intraoperative complications. Two months after surgery we found a cystoid macular edema with a decrease of visual acuity. After a therapy of topical steroids and systemic Carboanhydrase inhibitor the cystoid macular edema diminuished. The final visual acuity was 1.0.

OCT: showing a residual perfluorodecaline vesicle in an optic disc pit (ODP) of a deep excavated  glaucomatous optic nerve head. 
Discussion:
Perfluorodecalin is a perfluorocarbon liquid used intraoperatively in retinal detachment repair. The clarity of perfluorocarbon liquids, with a refractive index is close to that of water. It is usually removed at the end of the procedure. However, residual amounts may be retained. Peyman et al. (1) reported, that perfluorocarbon liquids have been used to facilitate surgery in a wide variety of conditions, including proliferative vitreoretinopathy, giant retinal tears, drainage of suprachoroidal hemorrhages, diabetic traction, retinal detachments with a rhegmatogenous component, dislocated crystalline or intraocular lenses, and retinal detachment associated with choroidal coloboma. All perfluorocarbon liquids when used as tamponading agents can compress and disorganize the retina. This ""toxicity"" is a physical effect rather than chemical toxicity and depends upon the amount of perfluorocarbon liquid injected. Perfluorocarbon liquids are not tolerated in the anterior chamber, causing corneal edema within 2-3 days at the site of contact.

Purpose: To describe the morphologic changes of a retinal macroaneurysm.

Methods: 
Patient underwent ophthalmoscopy, FFA, and Heidelberg spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT)

Findings: 
Ophthalmoscopy: subretinal hemorrhage, retinal exudate
FFA: lack of early hyperfluorescence, focal hypofluorescence due to retinal hemorrhage.
OCT: superficial retinal hemorrhage, intraretinal lipids, and minor intraretinal edema prominently involving the outer retinal layers.

Discussion: 
Arterial macroaneurysms comprise a distinct retinal vascular disorder. Most commonly seen in elderly females, the disorder is often associated with underlying hypertension and systemic arteriosclerotic disease. The natural history is one of gradual and spontaneous involution with good visual prognosis in the majority of cases. Complications of retinal or vitreous hemorrhage and macular edema, with resultant loss of vision, can occur. Treatment is recommended when there is visual loss. Photocoagulation treatment may be applied directly to the macroaneurysm, indirectly by surrounding the macroaneurysm, or as a combination of these two methods. It remains unclear whether indirect treatment is superior to direct treatment (1).

Antiangiogenic intravitreal therapy has proven effective to close the RAMA and improve vision. Koinzer et al (1) examined N=49 charts of patients with RAMA and compared the long-term visual acuity (VA) in three groups according to treatment:  untreated, photocoagulation and vitrectomy.

Ocular Medical History: cataract surgery in 2012.
General Medical History: empty.
Purpose: to present a focal island of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule with a reproducible glaucoma-like visual field defect.
Methods: Colour Photography Anterior Segment, Visual Field, OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: localized island of lens epithelial cells on inferior posterior capsule.  
Visual Field: superior scotoma mimicking a reproducible glaucomatous visual field defect.
OCT:  Regular retinal nerve fiber thickness.
Discussion:  
Island of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule were common postoperatively. A focal collection of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule can mimic a glaucomatous visual field defect. García-Medina JJ  et al. (1) concluded that focal posterior capsular opacification may alter visual field results, and may even simulate the perimetric behaviour of other pathologies such as glaucoma. Consequently, the presence of  a focal posterior capsular opacification should be considered in the interpretation of any automated perimetry in pseudophakic patients.

(2) OCT: no reduction of retinal nerve fiber thickness. 

Discussion: 
Deposition of melanin granules on the corneal endothelium (Krukenberg spindle) is risk factor for glaucoma. Primary pigment dispersion syndrome (PDS) is a condition usually seen in younger myopic males that is characterized by radial defects of the iris pigment epithelium visible on retroillumination, with liberation and deposition of melanin granules on the corneal endothelium (Krukenberg spindle), on the posterior lens capsule, and in the trabecular meshwork and it is frequently associated with secondary open-angle glaucoma, and also referred to as pigmentary glaucoma, which is believed to be caused by melanin granules that, after being released from the iris pigment epithelium into the aqueous humor, lead to obstruction of the aqueous outflow pathways. The degree of retrocorneal Krukenberg spindle, are graded semiquantitatively by means of the following scale: not present, trace, mild, moderate, and marked. Extensive dispersion of melanin granules, sometimes associated with a marked rise of intraocular pressure, has been described after medical pupillary dilation

Fundus Autofluorescence (OS): inherent autofluorescent properties of drusen in optic nerve head.
Discussion: 
Optic nerve head drusen are calcific deposits buried or at the surface of the optic disc. Nentwich et al. reported (1) that drusen of the optic disc occur in 0.34 to 2.4 % of human individuals. Within histological sections drusen are found six times more often than on funduscopic examination. Diagnostic tools include fundus-autofluorescence, optical coherence tomography and ultrasound. Fundus Autofluorescence  shows inherent autofluorescent properties of optic nerve head drusen. Drusen of the optic nerve head can lead to transient visual impairment, and to profound visual field defects in adulthood. The mechanism of drusen-related field loss is poorly understood. Tso (2) proposed that disc drusen are a consequence of abnormal axonal metabolism leading to the deposition of calcium crystals in mitochondria and disruption of axons with further accumulation of calcified cellular contents.

Discussion:
Jonas et al (1) described morphological optic nerve head variables to classify glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Thus, glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy is classified by morphologic changes in the intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer: size and shape of the optic disc; size, shape and pallor of the neuroretinal rim; size of the optic cup in relation to the area of the disc; configuration and depth of the optic cup; cup-to-disc diameter ratio and cup-to-disc area ratio; presence and location of splinter-shaped haemorrhages; occurrence, size, configuration and location of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy; diffuse and/or focal decrease of the diameter of the retinal arterioles; and visibility of the retinal nerve fibre layer. Assessment of these variables is useful for the detection of glaucomatous optic nerve damage, and to differentiate various types of optic nerve atrophy. He suggested, that highest diagnostic power had the vertical cup-to-disc diameter ratio corrected for its dependence on the optic disc size, total neuroretinal rim area, rim-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size, and cup-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size. Oliveira C et al (2) using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope found a mean optic disc size in white subjects of 1.97+-0.6 mm².

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Ocular medical history: increased intraocular pressure, no topical therapy.
General medical history: empty.
Main complaint: none.
Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, HRT, OCT, FDT, ww-Perimetry
Findings:
(a) Ophthalmoscopy: optic disc size is increased, neuroretinal rim shape follows ISNT rule, no pallor;  size of the optic cup is not increased in relation to the area of the disc; no splinter-shaped haemorrhages; no parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy.
(b) HRT: optic disc size 2,9 mm² at OD, 2,8 mm² at OS; neuroretinal rim area size regular with 1.2 mm² at OD, 1.3 mm² at OS; neuroretinal rim area shape follows ISNT rule. The size of the optic cup is not increased in relation to the area of the disc (OD: area C/D-ratio 0,41, linear C/D-ratio 0.64, OS: area C/D-ratio 0.5, linear C/D-ratio 0.71).

Discussion:
Jonas et al (1) described morphological optic nerve head variables to classify glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Thus, glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy is classified by morphologic changes in the intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer: size and shape of the optic disc; size, shape and pallor of the neuroretinal rim; size of the optic cup in relation to the area of the disc; configuration and depth of the optic cup; cup-to-disc diameter ratio and cup-to-disc area ratio; presence and location of splinter-shaped haemorrhages; occurrence, size, configuration and location of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy; diffuse and/or focal decrease of the diameter of the retinal arterioles; and visibility of the retinal nerve fibre layer. Assessment of these variables is useful for the detection of glaucomatous optic nerve damage, and to differentiate various types of optic nerve atrophy. He suggested, that highest diagnostic power had the vertical cup-to-disc diameter ratio corrected for its dependence on the optic disc size, total neuroretinal rim area, rim-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size, and cup-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size. Oliveira C et al (2) using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope found a mean optic disc size in white subjects of 1.97+-0.6 mm².

Findings: 
(1) OS: Retinal microinfarct during therapy with Interferon beta
(2) OS: Regular retina, 4 months after finishing therapy with Interferon beta
Discussion:
Interferons are natural glycoproteins and have antiviral, anti-proliferative and immune regulatory functions. There are several classes including interferon alpha, beta and gamma. Interferons alpha and beta are used in the treatment of several diseases including hepatitis C, cancer and immune-mediated conditions such as multiple sclerosis. Nearly 500 cases of ophthalmological complications related to interferon have been reported (1). The main ophthalmological complication from interferon treatment is essentially a vascular retinopathy  with soft exudates, hemorrhages or retinal ischemia. Hayasaka et al. (2) reported that systemic hypertension and diabetes mellitus were clear risk factors for eye disease during therapy with interferons. Frequent exposure to interferon may induce the production of autoantibodies leading to the deposition of immune complexes in the retina or retinal vessels (3).

Discussion:
It was shown by Liu et al. (1) that progression and regression of DR were strongly associated with blood pressure and glycemic exposure.  In a huge study they investigated the progression and regression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the effects of population risk factors on the rates of transition across retinopathy stages. From 1990 to 2011   4,758 diabetic patients who were diagnosed at 35 years of age or older were observed. They found a consistent risk effect of HbA1c on the progression  from no retinopathy to mild background DR a hazard ratio per SD of HbA1c  of 1.42, from mild BDR to observable BDR a hazard ratio of 1.32, and from observable BDR to severe nonproliferative/proliferative DR a hazard ratio of 2.23. Similarly, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure increased the risk for the transition from the asymptomatic phase to mild BDR  with a hazard ratio of 1.20 and from the mild BDR to observable BDR with a hazard ratio of 1.87, respectively. Regression from mild BDR to no DR was associated with lower SBP and lower HbA1c .

Discussion: In general pits of the optic nerve head (OPD) are oval cavities or depressions in the optic disc. Itis a herniation of dysplastic retinal tissue into a collagen rich excavation extending into the subarachnoid space through a defect in the lamina cribrosa.  Pits of the optic nerve can appear as a localized pit-like invagination in the optic disc. They can be congenital or acquired. ODPs can remain clinically asymptomatic in many cases. In about 50% patients with ODPs develop optic disc pit related maculopathy with retinoschisis, atrophy of inner retinal layers, serous macular detachment and significant loss of vision. 1-2

Fluorescein Angiography: peripheral retinal ischaemia
OCT: subretinal fluid, retinal exudation. 
Discussion:
Coats' disease (retinal telangiectasis) is a sporadic disorder characterized by a defect in retinal vascular development resulting in vessel leakage, subretinal exudation and retinal detachment. Black GC et al. (1) has indicated probable role of somatic mutation in the NDP gene in the pathogenesis of Coats' disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified (2) as a key regulator in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Coats' disease demonstrates vascular abnormalities, associated exudation, and manifests as teleangiectasia and aneurysms. Exudative subretinal lipid deposits can be extensive. Coats' disease is unilateral and affects predominantly healthy young males. Joussen AM (3) suggested that Coats' disease as a progressive disease requires lifelong follow-up and therapy. Treatment consisted of cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation and bevacizumab intravitreal injection.

Discussion:
Coats' disease (retinal telangiectasis) is a sporadic disorder characterized by a defect in retinal vascular development resulting in vessel leakage, subretinal exudation and retinal detachment. Black GC et al. (1) has indicated probable role of somatic mutation in the NDP gene in the pathogenesis of Coats' disease. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been identified (2) as a key regulator in angiogenesis and vascular permeability. Coats' disease demonstrates vascular abnormalities, associated exudation, and manifests as teleangiectasia and aneurysms. Exudative subretinal lipid deposits can be extensive. Coats' disease is unilateral and affects predominantly healthy young males. Joussen AM (3) suggested that Coats' disease as a progressive disease requires lifelong follow-up and therapy. Treatment consisted of cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation and bevacizumab intravitreal injection.

Discussion:
Congenital cataract is a leading cause of childhood blindness, accounting for 10~38% of blindness in children. The prevalence of congenital cataract is estimated to be 0.6~6 per 10,000 live births (1). Various etiological factors have been reported, including infection, neonatal asphyxia, malnutrition, and genetic defects. 8.3%~25% of congenital cataracts were inherited. Several genes have been identified to be associated with congenital cataracts, such as genes encoding crystallins, connexins and other membrane proteins, beaded filament proteins, growth and transcription factors, and others.
The crystallins are the main structural proteins of the eye lens (2). The alphaA-crystallin is a molecular chaperone. It is expressed mainly in the lens. Mutations in the Cryaa gene lead to recessive or dominant cataracts. Altered gamma-crystallins is a key event in cataract formation. Cataract formation, caused by Cryg mutations is characterized by stopping the secondary lens fiber differentiation as indicated by the presence of remnants of cell nuclei, which are usually degraded in secondary fiber cells. 
One of several molecular mechanism underlying the congenital hereditary cataract is caused by the recently characterized A2V mutation in βB2-crystallin. It was reported (3) that the tetramerization of βB2-crystallin was retarded by the A2V mutation. They showed, that the A2V-mutation slightly decreased the thermal stability and promoted the thermal aggregation of βB2-crystallin. A2V mutation lead to injury of lens optical properties by decreasing βB2-crystallin stability. The minor changes by the A2V mutation was consistent with the phenotype in the patients, who noticed their optical defects at the twenties. As age increased, damages in βB2-crystallin would accumulate by the unavoidable physical and chemical stresses. The slight decrease in thermal stability of the mutated βB2-crystallin finally led to the onset of cataract much earlier than normal people, but later than those highly harmful mutations.

Discussion:
Congenital cataract is a leading cause of childhood blindness, accounting for 10~38% of blindness in children. The prevalence of congenital cataract is estimated to be 0.6~6 per 10,000 live births (1). Various etiological factors have been reported, including infection, neonatal asphyxia, malnutrition, and genetic defects. 8.3%~25% of congenital cataracts were inherited. Several genes have been identified to be associated with congenital cataracts, such as genes encoding crystallins, connexins and other membrane proteins, beaded filament proteins, growth and transcription factors, and others.
The crystallins are the main structural proteins of the eye lens (2). The alphaA-crystallin is a molecular chaperone. It is expressed mainly in the lens. Mutations in the Cryaa gene lead to recessive or dominant cataracts. Altered gamma-crystallins is a key event in cataract formation. Cataract formation, caused by Cryg mutations is characterized by stopping the secondary lens fiber differentiation as indicated by the presence of remnants of cell nuclei, which are usually degraded in secondary fiber cells. 
One of several molecular mechanism underlying the congenital hereditary cataract is caused by the recently characterized A2V mutation in βB2-crystallin. It was reported (3) that the tetramerization of βB2-crystallin was retarded by the A2V mutation. They showed, that the A2V-mutation slightly decreased the thermal stability and promoted the thermal aggregation of βB2-crystallin. A2V mutation lead to injury of lens optical properties by decreasing βB2-crystallin stability. The minor changes by the A2V mutation was consistent with the phenotype in the patients, who noticed their optical defects at the twenties. As age increased, damages in βB2-crystallin would accumulate by the unavoidable physical and chemical stresses. The slight decrease in thermal stability of the mutated βB2-crystallin finally led to the onset of cataract much earlier than normal people, but later than those highly harmful mutations.

Discussion:
Involvement of the optic nerve, either because of inflammation or increased intracranial pressure, is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease. Lesser reported (1) that the spirochete in Lyme disease invades the eye early and remains dormant. Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations include neuroretinitis, optic atrophy, disc edema, and involvement of multiple cranial nerves (seventh nerve paresis, Bell's palsy). Criteria for Lyme disease include the lack of evidence of other disease, other clinical findings consistent with Lyme disease, occurrence in patients living in an endemic area, positive serology, and, in most cases, response to treatment.

Discussion:
Retinal arterial occlusions (CRAO) occurs secondary to an emboli, which may originate from atheromatous plaques in the ascending aorta or carotid arteries, as well as calcified heart valves. Brown et al. (1) reviewed a series of 107 cases with central retinal artery occlusions (CRAO). 26% showed a  macular sparing owing to a patent cilioretinal artery. Patients with patent cilioretinal sparing regained variable degrees of visual acuity. CRAO without cilioretinal sparing rarely regained any useful vision.

Discussion: Ocular manifestations of systemic hypertension are common and result in vascular compromise at the level of the retina, the choroid, or the optic nerve. Hypertensive choroidopathy is caused by fibrinoid necrosis of the choroidal arterioles. Hypertensive choroidopathy is characterized by hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris, break down of the retinal pigment epithelial cells, and hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots). Hypertensive choroidopathy is a complication of systemic hypertension and can be the harbinger of a life-threatening hypertensive emergency.

Discussion:
The Swedish Thalidomide Study (1987–1989) [1-4] described the ophthalmologic findings of thalidomide-exposed embryos: incomitant strabismus, usually of the Duane type, aberrant tearing, coloboma, microphthalmia, and facial nerve palsy. Thalidomide [α-(N-phthalimido)-glutarimide] was synthesized in 1954 under the brand name of Contergan. Thalidomide was a popular treatment for anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and hyperemesis. Thalidomide is an extremely potent teratogenic drug capable of causing severe systemic malformations to an exposed fetus during the sensitive period. In addition to limb anomalies, craniofacial anomalies, ocular motility dysfunction and structural eye malformations were reported. Approximately 5000 cases of malformed live births occurred worldwide. The survival rate of thalidomide-exposed embryos was estimated to be between 40 and 50%. More than 10 000 pregnancies may have been affected. Thalidomide caused malformations primarily between 20 and 36 days after fertilization.

They look like little needles in the eye going in all directions and assume the shape of a Christmas tree. The needles change color when the angle of the incident light is changed. In Christmas tree cataract,the adjacent areas of the lens remain clear.

It has been said that with increasing age there is degradation of the peptides and amino acids within the lens by endopeptidases. There is an increase in calcium ions and this local increase in calcium ions stimulates the endopeptidases resulting in protein breakdown. The breakdown products are subsequently deposited in the lumen of the reticular meshwork forming the Christmas tree cataract. The crystals are thus taken to be made of cystine (an amino acid). Accumulation of cystine beyond the point of crystallization causes the formation of needles that gives the fascinating appearance of the Christmas tree in the eye.

Ocular medical history: slow decrease of vision in OS.

General medical history: stenosis of ispilateral internal carotid artery, stroke in 2005. 

Main complaint: glare and decrease of vision at OS. 

Methods: colour photography.

Findings: 
Colour photography showed highly refractile multicolored ""needles"" crisscrossing the lens fibers. 

Discussion:
Christmas tree cataract consists of highly refractile multicolored ""needles"" crisscrossing the lens fibers of the deep cortex. The fact that the colors vary according to the angle of the incident light, and that in retroillumination only a dim outline of the cataract is seen, would suggest that Christmas tree cataract is a diffractive phenomenon. In a study 8 lenses with Christmas tree cataract were investigated by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (1). They found that the needles are smooth, rectangular, plate-like elements bordered by membranes and amorphous material and running crisscross through the lens. The needles proved to be largely dissolved, but the remains showed regular spacings of approximately 5 nm. The needles have a high sulfur content and pronounced S-S, CS-SC, and C-S vibrations. The cytoplasm adjacent to the needles and reticular meshwork had an elevated Ca++ content. They concluded that cystine is the most likely candidate for the Christmas tree needles and that the needles probably are formed as the result of an age-related aberrant breakdown of crystallins induced by elevated Ca++ levels.

Discussion: Ocular coloboma is a common malformation. It includes a spectrum of anomalies that ranges from iris coloboma to clinical anophthalmos. Coloboma is etiologically heterogeneous. The spectrum  can vary from small colobomas located in the equatorial region that do not interfere with vision, to large colobomas involving the disc and macula with severe impairment of vision. Choroidal coloboma is a congenital defect caused by defective closure of embryonal fissure, which normally takes place during the 6th week of gestation. As an isolated defect, it is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs (1, 3). Gopal L et al. (2) described choroidal colobomas. Genetic as well as environmental causes have been proposed to cause an intrauterine insult that can lead to defective closure of the embryonal fissure leading to coloboma of the fundus (3). Histologically, the colobomatous area is deficient in normal choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and the retina.

Discussion:
The Swedish Thalidomide Study (1987–1989) [1-4] described the ophthalmologic findings of thalidomide-exposed embryos: incomitant strabismus, usually of the Duane type, aberrant tearing, coloboma, microphthalmia, and facial nerve palsy. Thalidomide [α-(N-phthalimido)-glutarimide] was synthesized in 1954 under the brand name of Contergan. Thalidomide was a popular treatment for anxiety, insomnia, gastritis, and hyperemesis. Thalidomide is an extremely potent teratogenic drug capable of causing severe systemic malformations to an exposed fetus during the sensitive period. In addition to limb anomalies, craniofacial anomalies, ocular motility dysfunction and structural eye malformations were reported. Approximately 5000 cases of malformed live births occurred worldwide. The survival rate of thalidomide-exposed embryos was estimated to be between 40 and 50%. More than 10 000 pregnancies may have been affected. Thalidomide caused malformations primarily between 20 and 36 days after fertilization.

https://www.atlasophthalmology.net/photo.jsf?node=9012&locale=en,"conjunctival hyperemia, bilateral secondary to prostaglandin analog use for glaucoma","Prostaglandin analogs can be used for the treatment of open-angle glaucoma through the reduction of intraocular pressure.  Prostaglandins reduce the intraocular pressure by increasing the outflow of aqueous fluid from the eye.  By reducing intraocular pressure, they suppress the effects of glaucoma.  Prostaglandins are administered through eye drop solution. 

A side effect of prostaglandin use is the development of conjunctival hyperemia.  Hyperemia is a condition in which there is an increase in blood flow to a specific part of the body, in this case, the sclera of the eye.  However, conjunctival hyperemia may be associated with wide range of ocular diseases, and can also be a response to allergic inflammation or irritation.  Therefore, it is important that a physician distinguish the underlying disorder before altering medication.

The incidence of hyperemia varies with the drug being utilized.  Latanaprost has exhibited an incidence of 5%-15%1, bimatoprost at 15%-45%2, and travoprost at 35%-50%3.  It is believed that prostaglandins cause the aqueous to utilize ocular circulation, resulting in the vasodilation observed.  It is important to note that these side effects often manifest at the beginning of treatment and usually return to baseline levels after a few weeks. This is most likely due to adaptation to the drug.  Therefore, patients who have had previous exposure to prostaglandins will probably respond with less hyperemia if another drug is prescribed.

Some of the other side effects of prostaglandins include blurred vision, a decrease in visual acuity, dry eyes, inflammation in the anterior chamber of the eye, and skin rash or allergic skin reaction.  Itching, burning, and stinging during administration of the drug is also a common side effect.  Other less common side effects are cystoid macular edema, overgrowth of eyelashes, darkening of eyelid skin color,  and darkening of iris color.

This patient was switched to another brand of prostaglandin glaucoma drops because after several months, his conjunctival hyperemia would not improve.  This patient has primary open angle glaucoma, the number one type of glaucoma in African-Americans.

Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

Discussion: 
Choi et al. (1) reported that optic disc pits had a diverse structure according to the alteration of the lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue. Optic disc pit is often associated with a corresponding scotoma. Choi et al. (1) suggested, that a compliant lamina cribrosa or prelaminar tissue may become susceptible to the damaging effects of increased IOP values. The ongoing insult to the optic nerve may then influence the lamina cribrosa tissue or prelaminar tissue, exhibiting the appearance of alteration in the lamina cribrosa or or prelaminar tissue. Subsequently, the axons passing through the altered lamina cribrosa and or prelaminar tissue are likely to be damaged by loss of structural support, loss of nutrient supply from laminar capillaries, or loss of metabolic support from astrocytes.

1) Colour Photography: bilateral optic nerve atrophy (OS>OD).
2) VEP: decreased amplitudes und prolonged latencies.
3) OCT: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.
Discussion:
It was reported (1,2), that antibiotic therapy with Linezolid (Zyvoxid®) can cause optic nerve atrophy. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, used against infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may lead to progressive, potentially irreversible neuropathies of the optic nerve especially in long-time application.
Linezolid is part of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal initiation complex. Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

In 10/2011 beginn of systemic therapy with Adriamycin, Cytrarabin, and Mitoxatron.

Ocular Medical History: in 01/2012 fast reduction of VA at OS after systemic therapy over three weeks with meropenem (Meronem®, vancomycin und linezolid (Zyvoxid®).
Main Complaint: reduction of VA in OS.
Findings:
1) Colour Photography: bilateral optic nerve atrophy (OS>OD).
2) VEP: decreased amplitudes und prolonged latencies.
3) OCT: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.
Discussion:
It was reported (1,2), that antibiotic therapy with Linezolid (Zyvoxid®) can cause optic nerve atrophy. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, used against infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may lead to progressive, potentially irreversible neuropathies of the optic nerve especially in long-time application.
Linezolid is part of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal initiation complex. Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

Purpose: to present reduced homonymous retinal ganglien cell layer of OD and OS corresponding to homonymous visual field defect after partial tumor resection of pilocytic atrocytoma  in cerebral neurofibromatosis.

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), visual field, MRI. 

Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Segment:  optic nerve atrophy in OD and OS.
SD-OCT : decreased thickness of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in nasal and temporal area, OD>OS.
SD-OCT :  homonymous thinning of of retinal ganglion cell layer in OD and OS nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior to the fovea corresponding to homonymous visual field field defect.
Visual Field: homonymous field defect in OD and OS.
MRI: after partial tumor resection extensive defect area with surrounding gliosis in the left temporal and occipital lobes involving the left optic radiation.   

Discussion:
It is recognized that significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss occurs in MS patients following optic neuritis. A reduction in RGC may be identified earlier due to transient edema in the acute stage of ON masking any early RNFL loss. Several recent studies (1, 2) have suggested that RGC layer thinning is a good measure of disease-related visual and general disability and brain atrophy. Ocular manifestations of Von Recklinghausen disease are frequent and can reveal the disease. Benchekroun O et al. (3) examined 11 patients with Neurofibromatosis during two years. He suggested that an ophthalmologic examination must always be performed if Von Recklinghausen is suspected.

Discussion:
Involvement of the optic nerve, either because of inflammation or increased intracranial pressure, is a rare manifestation of Lyme disease. Lesser reported (1) that the spirochete in Lyme disease invades the eye early and remains dormant. Neuro-ophthalmic manifestations include neuroretinitis, optic atrophy, disc edema, and involvement of multiple cranial nerves (seventh nerve paresis, Bell's palsy). Criteria for Lyme disease include the lack of evidence of other disease, other clinical findings consistent with Lyme disease, occurrence in patients living in an endemic area, positive serology, and, in most cases, response to treatment.

Visible effect of antiinflammatory therapy of cystoid macular edema (CME) after cataract surgery presented by OCT from February and March 2013: Disappearance of cystoid macular edema, persisting epiretinal membrane. Patient: 72 years of age, male; BCVA OS 0.1, nuclear cataract. Ocular medical history: deterioration of vision over two years, regular cataract surgery with small incision at February 4th 2013, no increase of BCVA in February 27th 2013 due to cystoid macular edema. Begin of therapy with oral carboanhydrase inhibitors (250mg/d), and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for three weeks. General medical history: rheumatoid arthritis, arterial hypertension. Main complaint: lack of improvement of vision after cataract surgery. Purpose: to show improvement of cystoid macular edema within four weeks under oral carboanhydrase inhibitors and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Method: Patient undergone spectralis-OCT before and after begin of therapy Findings: OCT from February 27th 2013: cystoid macular edema with epiretinal membrane. OCT from March 25th 2013: no cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane. Discussion: Suggested factors in CME after cataract surgery include hypotony, vitreous traction, and inflammation. There is the hypothesis, disruption of the BAB is a dominating factor in CME. It was suggested (1) that inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, which are biosynthesized by the anterior uvea and lens epithelial cells, are triggered by surgical trauma, leading to disruption of the BAB. As a result, various inflammatory mediators accumulate in the aqueous humor. The mediators are dispersed throughout the vitreous and increase the permeability of retinal vessels. The blood–retinal barrier (BRB) becomes disrupted, inducing CME over time. Predispositions to BAB and BRB disruption include aging, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and other diseases. Data (2) suggest that the inflammatory mediators increase in the aqueous for 1 to 2 weeks after cataract and IOL surgery. It was shown (3), that topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) prevents the spike-like increase of flare, implying that NSAIDs are more effective than steroidal agents in preventing postoperative inflammation. Nepafenac was more effective than fluorometholone in preventing CME and BAB disruption and in providing early recovery of vision. Literature: K.

Patient: 69 years of age, male, BCVA 0.63 at OD, 0.63 at OS, IOP 20/31 mmHg. 
Ocular Medical History: pseudoexfoliation material at anterior lens capsule, increased intraocular pressure in OS in secondary ocular hypertension in pseudoexfoliation syndrome. 
General Medical History: diabetes.
Main Complaint: blur at OS. 
Purpose: to explore the structural features in deep and superficial retinal layer of diabetic retinopathy using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and Fluorescence Angiography (FFA).
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, Fluorescence Angiography, Triton OCT, Triton OCT-Angiography
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: no retinal hemorrhages, no glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy.
Triton OCT, ring scan: regular retinal nerve fiber thickness.
FFA (0:39 s): several microaneurysms, one parafoveolar retinal hemorrhage.
Triton OCT-Angiography, Deep Retinal Layer: impaired capillary perfusion with several microaneurysms.
Triton OCT-Angiography, Superficial Retinal Layer: increased foveolar avascular zone, no microaneurysms.
Triton OCT-Angiography, Choriocapillaris: mainly regular capillary perfusion in choriocapillaris, less focal drop outs.
 Mosaic, FFA, Triton OCT-Angiography of Deep Retinal Layer: some microaneurysms confirmed by FFA are not visualized by OCTA, and some other microaneurysms confirmed by OCTA could not be visualized by FFA. 
Discussion: Microaneurysms are defined as hyperfluorescent spots in the early and/or late phases of Fluorescence Angiography. Hamada M  et al (1) found 90% of microaneurysms in the deep plexus. Ishibazawa A et al. (1) and Couturier et al. (2) reported an incomplete agreement between microaneurysms shown on FFA and those shown on OCTA. Several explanations are possible for why microaneurysms were not depicted by OCTA en face images but in FFA  and vice versa: absence of blood flow due to microaneurysm closure, microaneurysms with open lumens but without blood flow, and  thickened microaneurysm walls inhibiting the detection of flow signals.

Discussion: Diabetic macular edema (DME) is a leading cause of blindness in most industrialized nations. Diabetic macular  edema is characterised by exudative fluid accumulation in the macula. It affects one in 15 people with diabetes resulting in more than 20 million cases worldwide. Pathogenesis of DME is related to the breakdown of the blood–retina barrier, leaking microaneurysms , upregulated cytokine, and other factors. Enhanced expression of the proangiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A has been validated in patients with DME. Hasegawa N  et al. (1) demonstrated that the density of the microaneurysms in the deep capillary plexus (DCP)  was significantly associated with the macular edema volume and that microaneurysms contributed to the pathogenesis of DME.

Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: regular optic nerve head in OD and OS.

Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

Discussion
Fuchs' corneal dystrophy - a dominantly inherited disorder -  is a slowly progressive, bilateral corneal dystrophy that affects corneal endothelial cells. 
Cataract surgery is a risk factor for corneal endothelial cell loss. Corneal endothelial cell loss, a major complication that sometimes occurs after cataract surgery, can lead to corneal edema and decompensation if cell density falls to 500 cells/mm2 or below. Yamazoe et al (1) reported that the mean rate of endothelial cell loss is about 12% ± 23%.  Seitzman  et al (2) reported a series of patients with Fuchs' dystrophy (136 eyes) undergoing cataract surgery. The average preoperative corneal thickness ranged from 482 to 674 µm. 37% had preoperative corneal thickness of 600 µm or thicker. Of eyes with preoperative pachymetry measurements of 600 µm or thicker, 10% progressed to penetrating keratoplasty. Patients with a preoperative corneal thickness of >640 μm had a 22.2% rate of requiring a corneal transplant. Their data suggest that current cataract removal techniques allow for excellent visual rehabilitation in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy who have a preoperative corneal thickness lower than 600 µm. They recommend a concurrent penetrating keratoplasty with cataract surgery in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy and a corneal thickness of >640 μm.

Patient: 25 years of age, male, BCVA 0.4 at OD, 0.2 at OS.
General Medical History: major electrical injury (3000 V)  in July 2013 with skin burns on the face, neck, hand, and inner left arm.
Ocular Medical History: 12 months later development of cataract in both eyes with decreased visual acuity. 
Purpose: to present electrically induced cataract in both eyes induced by high voltage current.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, VEP.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: cataractous changes with characteristic anterior subcapsular opacifications.
VEP: decreased amplitude in OS, regular amplitude in OD.
Discussion: 
Saffle et al. reviewed patients suffering major electrical injuries. Patients who suffered cataracts were injured with high (greater than 1,000-v) voltage current. All patients suffered true 'entrance and exit' wounds. Cataracts first presented as decreased visual acuity 1 to 12 months postinjury. Electrical cataracts remain a serious potential complication of electrical injury.

OCT OD: diffused optic disc swelling with almost total disappearance of the physiological cup, ONH fiber crowding. 

Patient: 72 years of age, female, BCVA perception of light at OD, 0.6 at OS.
Ocular Medical History: marked loss of vision in one eye and signs of involvement in other eye. C-reactive protein evaluation was 69 mg/l. Patient showing a high index of suspicion of giant cell arteritis was immediately started on systemic corticosteroid therapy and had temporal artery biopsy performed. Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis was confirmed on temporal artery biopsy. 
General medical history: headache.
Purpose: to present anterior ischemic optic neuropathy in both eyes in giant cell arteritis.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Segment OD: papilloedema, diffuse swelling, blurred border, no hemorrhage around the disc rim.
Colour Photography Posterior Segment OS: sectoral swelling and blurred border at 6h, no hemorrhage around the disc rim.
OCT OD: diffused optic disc swelling with almost total disappearance of the physiological cup, ONH fiber crowding. 
OCT OS: sectorial peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer edema at 6h. 

Discussion:
Arteritis temporalis shows a variable course of the disease and may lead to transient or permanent visual loss. Hayeh et al. (1) reported, that patients with giant cell arteritis presented a variety of ocular symptoms : visual loss of varying severity in 98%, amaurosis fugax in 31%, diplopia in 6%, and eye pain in 8%. Because giant cell arteritis is a potentially blinding disease and its early diagnosis is the key to preventing blindness, it is important to recognize its various ocular manifestations. When systemically apparent, arteritis temporalis can progress to reduction of general health, cerebral ischemia and organ infarction (2).

Discussion:
Sandali et al. (1) proposed a Fourier-domain OCT classification containing 5 distinct keratoconus stages. Stage 1 demonstrates thinning of apparently normal epithelial and stromal layers at the conus. Stage 2 demonstrates hyperreflective anomalies occurring at the Bowman's layer level with epithelial thickening at the conus. Stage 3 demonstrates posterior displacement of the hyperreflective structures occurring at the Bowman's layer level with increased epithelial thickening and stromal thinning. Stage 4 demonstrates pan-stromal scar. Stage 5 demonstrates hydrops; 5a, acute onset: Descemet's membrane rupture and dilaceration of collagen lamellae with large fluid-filled intrastromal cysts; 5b, healing stage: pan-stromal scarring with a remaining aspect of Descemet's membrane rupture. 
Miyata et al. (2) found, that the intracameral air injection is a useful therapy to shorten the period of corneal edema in acute hydrops secondary to keratoconus. He reported that the average period of persistence of corneal edema was 20 days in the intracameral air injection group and 65 days in the control group.

In iritis the inflammation predominantly involves the iris and in iridocyclitis, the inflammation involves the iris and pars plica of the ciliary body equally. Acute uveitis has a sudden onset and persists for less than 6 weeks. Etiological factors include: trauma, infections with bacteria, fungi, virus protozoa, systemic collagen vascular diseases and unknown, idiopathic causes. The most frequent cause for acute anterior uveitis is idiopathic. The classical five symptoms of acute anterior uveitis are: pain, redness, watering, photophobia and blurring of vision. The typical findings include circumcorneal congestion, keratic precipitates, miosis, anterior chamber cells, flare, fibrin, hypopyon, posterior synechiae and anterior vitreous cells. This young male presented with acute anterior uveitis. All the investigations were normal. He was started on hourly topical steroids and cycloplegics.

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

Main Complant: decreased vision after exposure to a green laser pointer.
Purpose: to present instrinsic repair of Laser pointer maculopathy. 
Methods: Colour Image Posterior Pole, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography  OCT, Fluorescein angiography FFA
Findings:
Colour Image Posterior Pole: just after laser exposure yellowish round spot in the foveal area.
Colour Image Posterior Pole: two months after laser exposure partial resolution yellowish round spot, persistent alterations at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium.
OCT: just after laser exposure disruption of the external limiting membrane, impairment of photoreceptor zone of the inner segments, and interdigitation zone.
OCT: two months after laser exposure partial resolution of the outer retinal disruption compared to initial visit with persistent, small foveal photoreceptor defects, residual disruption of the outer retinal layer at the fovea remained unchanged.
FFA: two months after laser exposure increased central avascular zone, late ill-defined leakage. 
Discussion: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 4 major classes of lasers (I–IV), of which the laser pointers belong to class IIIA (1). Diode laser pointers of red–orange (633–650 nm wavelength) are safer than the green–blue (400–500 nm). Injuries to the eye can occur within few seconds when the exposed to class III lasers that emit up to 5 mW power. Hossein et al. (2) reported, that after treatment with a systemic high-dose corticosteroid the initially visible hyperreflective band in the foveal region disappeared.

General Medical History: kidney transplantion in 2001, taking oral cellsept, steroids immediately prior to presentation at 10.4.2016 with acute post transplant lymphoproliferative disease and deterioration of vision in OD.
Ocular Medical History: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis or acute retinal necrosis (ARN) was suspected at 10.4.2016. Cytomegali virus (CMV) was detected in the anterior chamber, intravenous course of acyclovir was initiated.
Purpose: to show effect of systemic therapy with acyclovir over 4 months in Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome in Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole, initial finding: small Kyrieleis’ plaques within the arteries, retinal infiltration , retinal vasculitis, vitreous opacity, 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole, after 4 months of therapy with aciclovir:  retinal vasculitis with Kyrieleis’ plaques within mainly all arteries, retinal necrosis. 
OCT, after 4 months of therapy with aciclovir: retinal necrosis, Kyrieleis’ plaques within the arteries.

Discussion: Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome in CMV retinitis is typical for immuno-compromised patients. Bonfioli et al. (1) summarize d, that acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is an uncommon intraocular inflammatory syndrome characterized by severe and diffuse uveitis, retinal vasculitis, and retinal necrosis. It occurs in immunocompetent patients, and can also be found in immunocompromised subjects. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV 1 and 2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been implicated in the etiology of ARN. The characteristic features  include iridocyclitis, vitritis, retinal necrosis, and retinal vasculitis with Kyrieleis’ vasculitis (2). Kyrieleis’ vasculitis is a condition in which white-yellowish exudates are placed in a beaded pattern within the retinal arteries. The diagnosis of ARN is usually based in clinical features. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in aqueous humor samples is useful to identify the etiology of the disease. The treatment of ARN includes intravenous acyclovir, corticosteroids and aspirin. To prevent fellow eye involvement, intravenous acyclovir is followed by oral acyclovir for 14 weeks. Alternatives to acyclovir include ganciclovir, foscarnet, famcyclovir, brivudine, and valgancyclovir.

Patient:76 years of age, male, BCVA 0.7 at OD, 0.6 at OS.
Ocular Medical History: blurry vision at OS since 3 years.
General Medical History: TPHA tests (TPPA IPAT) in serum positive (Titer <1:80), human immunodeficiency virus test negative, no evidence of neurosyphilis.  
Purose: to present  acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis (ASPPC) in an immunocompetent 76-year-old man as  reactivated syphilis.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, FFA, SD-OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: large, yellowish, placoid, outer retinal lesion. 
FFA: small focal hyperfluorescence in the area of the  hypofluorescent lesion, peripheral multifocal choroiditis with multifocal  leakages, diffuse late macular edema, papillary leakage, 
SD-OCT: cystoid macular edema, epiretinal gliosis. small amount of subretinal fluid.
Discussion:
Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis (ASPPC) is a rare manifestation of syphilis. (1-3) Fundus and angiographic changes in ASPPC may mimic other chorioretinal diseases, including acute posterior multifocal placoid pigmentepitheliopathy (APMPPE).  It was  suggested that inflammation-associated perfusion abnormalities of the choriocapillaris contribute to the pathophysiological process. Most cases respond to systemic treatment of the underlying Treponema pallidum infection.

Patient: 13 years of age, male, BCVA 1.0 at OD, 0.6 at OS.
Ocular Medical History: Young boy projected a handheld green laser pointer (532 nm green laser light, power < 5 mW, Class III Laser) through a window at the street. The reflected light from the glass leaded to a bilateral exposure of the macula. Two months later without any systemic therapy we found an instrinsic repair. 
General Medical History: empty.
Main Complant: decreased vision after exposure to a green laser pointer.
Purpose: to present instrinsic repair of Laser pointer maculopathy. 
Methods: Colour Image Posterior Pole, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography  OCT, Fluorescein angiography FFA
Findings:
Colour Image Posterior Pole: just after laser exposure yellowish round spot in the foveal area.
Colour Image Posterior Pole: two months after laser exposure partial resolution yellowish round spot, persistent alterations at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium.
OCT: just after laser exposure disruption of the external limiting membrane, impairment of photoreceptor zone of the inner segments, and interdigitation zone.
OCT: two months after laser exposure partial resolution of the outer retinal disruption compared to initial visit with persistent, small foveal photoreceptor defects, residual disruption of the outer retinal layer at the fovea remained unchanged.
FFA: two months after laser exposure increased central avascular zone, late ill-defined leakage. 
Discussion: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified 4 major classes of lasers (I–IV), of which the laser pointers belong to class IIIA (1). Diode laser pointers of red–orange (633–650 nm wavelength) are safer than the green–blue (400–500 nm). Injuries to the eye can occur within few seconds when the exposed to class III lasers that emit up to 5 mW power. Hossein et al. (2) reported, that after treatment with a systemic high-dose corticosteroid the initially visible hyperreflective band in the foveal region disappeared.

Purpose: to demonstrate OCT-A features in branch retinal vein occlusion including regular capillary perfusion in superficial macular layer  and impaired capillary perfusion in deep macular layer
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, FFA, Triton-OCT, Triton-OCTA, Visual Field.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: chronic branch retinal vein occlusion in upper hemisphere, hard exsudates, retinal hemorrhages. 
FFA: chronic branch vein occlusion with venous-venous shunting, micro- and macroaneurysms, ischemic areas, diffuse loss of capillary perfusion in the superior retina, focal areas of staining consistent with intraretinal fluid.
Triton OCT-A, paramacular area, superficial layer: regular capillary blood flow. 
Triton OCT-A, paramacular area, deep layer: venous-venous shunting, and microaneurysms. 
Triton OCT, macula, horizontal line: chronic branch vein occlusion with retinal and cystoid macular edema, hard exsudates.
Triton OCT, macula, vertical line: chronic branch vein occlusion with retinal and cystoid macular edema.
Visual Field: relative scotoma corresponding to chronic branch retinal vein occlusion in upper hemisphere.
Mosaic (Colour Photography Posterior Pole, OCTA, OCT): chronic branch retinal vein occlusion, cystoid macular edema, hard exsudates, retinal hemorrhages, superficial vascular layer presenting regular capillary blood flow, and deep vascular layer showing  microaneurysm and shunting vessels .
Discussion:
Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) enables mapping of retinal vascular layers and visualizing nonperfused areas. OCT-A is effective for evaluation of macular complications of RVO. Suzuki et al. (1) evaluating the retinal hemodynamics noninvasively by OCTA found that anti-VEGF therapy improved the retinal deep ischemia in RVOs.

Findings:

Discussion:
Roth spots (white-centred retinal haemorrhages) were classically described as septic emboli lodged in the retina of patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis. More recent histological evidence suggests, that they are not foci of bacterial abscess. They are nonspecific and may be found in many other diseases. A variety of insults can result in retinal capillary rupture. It was suggested by (1) and others, that in subacute bacterial endocarditis a low grade disseminated intravascular coagulopathy predisposes to capillary bleeding in the retinal vasculature. White-centred haemorrhage results from the rupture of retinal capillaries and the extrusion of whole blood. Subsequent platelet adhesion to damaged endothelium and the platelet release reaction initiates the coagulation cascade,  that results in the formation of a platelet-fibrin thrombus. Morphologically, this fibrin thrombus appears as a pale white lesion in the centre of the haemorrhage. White-centred haemorrhages are observed, can be subclassified according to common underlying mechanisms resulting in capillary rupture.

___Discussion: Preeclampsia is a multisystem disorder defined as new onset of arterial hypertension and proteinuria during the second half of pregnancy. Serous retinal detachment is a known complication of preeclampsia caused by choroidal ischemia and subsequent disruption of blood-retinal barrier. Poor perfusion of the choriocapillaris causes Elschnig's spots. Central serous chorioretinopathy, central cilioretinal artery or vein occlusion and optic nerve atrophy are pathological manifestations in complicated pregnancies, when arterial hypertension is present (PIH), in preeclampsia (PE) or eclampsia. HELLP syndrome means disseminated intravascular coagulation, and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura may lead to ocular manifestations with loss of visual field or acuity. 1-2

He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

It was reported (1), that anterior capsular opacification (ACO) or capsular contraction syndrome (CCS) is a known complication of continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis (CCC). Histopathologic studies have shown that anterior capsular opacification is due to lens epithelial cell metaplasia. Contact with intraocular lens biomaterial causes lens epithelial cells to undergo myofibroblastic changes and to produce extracellular matrix components. Suggested risk factors for ACO and membrane growth include pseudoexfoliation syndrome, advanced age, diabetes mellitus, uveitis, myopia, pigmentary retinal degeneration, capsulorhexis size, and IOL design and material. The contraction may cause decentration of the IOL.

General Medical History:  Histology confirmed Morbus Recklinghausen, spastic hemiplegia after partial tumor resection of pilocytic atrocytoma, shunt installation and postoperative radiation therapy. 
Ocular Medical History: homonymous visual field defect to the right side.  
Purpose: to present reduced homonymous retinal ganglien cell layer of OD and OS corresponding to homonymous visual field defect after partial tumor resection of pilocytic atrocytoma  in cerebral neurofibromatosis.

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), visual field, MRI. 

Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Segment:  optic nerve atrophy in OD and OS.
SD-OCT : decreased thickness of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in nasal and temporal area, OD>OS.
SD-OCT :  homonymous thinning of of retinal ganglion cell layer in OD and OS nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior to the fovea corresponding to homonymous visual field field defect.
Visual Field: homonymous field defect in OD and OS.
MRI: after partial tumor resection extensive defect area with surrounding gliosis in the left temporal and occipital lobes involving the left optic radiation.   

Discussion:
It is recognized that significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss occurs in MS patients following optic neuritis. A reduction in RGC may be identified earlier due to transient edema in the acute stage of ON masking any early RNFL loss. Several recent studies (1, 2) have suggested that RGC layer thinning is a good measure of disease-related visual and general disability and brain atrophy. Ocular manifestations of Von Recklinghausen disease are frequent and can reveal the disease. Benchekroun O et al. (3) examined 11 patients with Neurofibromatosis during two years. He suggested that an ophthalmologic examination must always be performed if Von Recklinghausen is suspected.

___General Medical History: aortic valve insufficiency, arterial hypertension. 
___Ocular Medical History: acute increase of intraocular pressure with values of 40 mmHg with glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy, followed by an incomplete central  retinal vein occlusion with cystoid macular edema,  and an intravitreal  antiVEGF-injection. 
___Main Complaint: decline of visual acuity at OD.
___Purpose: to present asymmetric macular capillary rarefication shown by OCT-angiography.
___Methods: colour photography posterior pole, Triton OCT-angiography, Triton OCT, visual field. 
___Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole, OD: pale optic nerve atrophy, focal retinal hemorrhages.
Visual field, OD: concentric visual field defect.
Triton OCT, OD:  thinning of retinal nerve layer.
Triton, OCT-angiography, OD : increased diameter of foveolar avascular Zone.
Triton, OCT-angiography, Mosaic OD & OS: in OD increased diameter of foveolar avascular zone compared to OS with regular foveolar avascular zone.
___Discussion:  In presented case the increased foveolar avascular zone and the rarefication of macular capillaries  in OD may be caused by the venous vascular dysregulation, and glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy. Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy with optic nerve deterioration, visual field defects, and vascular dysregulation and rarefication. Müller et al. and Zivkovicet al. investigated macular capillaries in glaucoma by OCT-angiography. Zivkovic M et al. (2) measured foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in NTG and healthy subjects. He reported that mean horizontal, mean vertical diameter, and FAZ area were significantly enlarged in the NTG group. Müller et al. (1)  investigated central macular microvasculature in glaucoma patients. He found in perimetric glaucoma patients significantly reduced density maps of superficial foveal flow.

Of the 2,480 lesions, 68% were benign and 32% were malignant. The most frequent benign tumors were dermoid cyst (14%) and cavernous hemangioma (9%). The most common malignant tumors were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (12%), basal cell carcinoma (3%), and orbital metastases (3%). Cavernous hemangioma only exceptionally compresses the optic nerve.

Patients with acute arterial hypertension can develop optic disk swelling with retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots. Optic disk edema (grade IV hypertensive retinopathy) is a marker of malignant hypertension. 1-2 Hypertensive optic neuropathy and optic disk edema leads to hypoxia at the optic nerve head producing proximal axoplasmic flow stasis and secondary axonal swelling.

General Medical History:  Histology confirmed Morbus Recklinghausen, spastic hemiplegia after partial tumor resection of pilocytic atrocytoma, shunt installation and postoperative radiation therapy. 
Ocular Medical History: homonymous visual field defect to the right side.  
Purpose: to present reduced homonymous retinal ganglien cell layer of OD and OS corresponding to homonymous visual field defect after partial tumor resection of pilocytic atrocytoma  in cerebral neurofibromatosis.

Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), visual field, MRI. 

Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Segment:  optic nerve atrophy in OD and OS.
SD-OCT : decreased thickness of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in nasal and temporal area, OD>OS.
SD-OCT :  homonymous thinning of of retinal ganglion cell layer in OD and OS nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior to the fovea corresponding to homonymous visual field field defect.
Visual Field: homonymous field defect in OD and OS.
MRI: after partial tumor resection extensive defect area with surrounding gliosis in the left temporal and occipital lobes involving the left optic radiation.   

Discussion:
It is recognized that significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss occurs in MS patients following optic neuritis. A reduction in RGC may be identified earlier due to transient edema in the acute stage of ON masking any early RNFL loss. Several recent studies (1, 2) have suggested that RGC layer thinning is a good measure of disease-related visual and general disability and brain atrophy. Ocular manifestations of Von Recklinghausen disease are frequent and can reveal the disease. Benchekroun O et al. (3) examined 11 patients with Neurofibromatosis during two years. He suggested that an ophthalmologic examination must always be performed if Von Recklinghausen is suspected.

Ocular Medical History: control of longlasting unilateral corectopia.
Purpose: to show bilateral choroidal coloboma with unilateral iridal coloboma.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, Colour Photography Anterior Segment, SD-OCT.
Findings: 
SD-OCT: bilateral  choroidal coloboma. 
Colour Photography Posterior Segment of OD: coloboma located in the equatorial region with attached retina along the margin of the coloboma.
Colour Photography Anterior Segment of OS: inferior corectopia upon light-induced miosis. 
Colour Photography Anterior Segment of OS: dilated pupil showing cataract, sectorial iridal coloboma and sectorial zonulalysis.
SD-OCT of OD: margin of choroidal coloboma appearance of a hump owing to inward turning of the retinochoroidal layers, no thickening of the layers at the margin.
Discussion: Ocular coloboma is a common malformation. It includes a spectrum of anomalies that ranges from iris coloboma to clinical anophthalmos. Coloboma is etiologically heterogeneous. The spectrum  can vary from small colobomas located in the equatorial region that do not interfere with vision, to large colobomas involving the disc and macula with severe impairment of vision. Choroidal coloboma is a congenital defect caused by defective closure of embryonal fissure, which normally takes place during the 6th week of gestation. As an isolated defect, it is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs (1, 3). Gopal L et al. (2) described choroidal colobomas. Genetic as well as environmental causes have been proposed to cause an intrauterine insult that can lead to defective closure of the embryonal fissure leading to coloboma of the fundus (3). Histologically, the colobomatous area is deficient in normal choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and the retina.

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm. 
Symptomatic choroidal metastases is a rare presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Choroidal metastases (CM) are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. CM is detected in 2% to 7% of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is generally discovered at the end-stage of the disease. Singh et al. (2) reported the demographic profile, histology, disease stage, ocular and lung lesions, diagnostic and treatment (systemic and ocular) modalities, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer : 67% of patients were male and 78% were current or ex-smokers, mean age was 55 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type followed by squamous and small cell. Bilateral involvement was rare (<10%). Ocular treatment modalities included radiation, enucleation, and systemic steroids. Regression of choroidal metastases with treatment was observed in 67% of patients who did not undergo enucleation.

Right eye has band keratopathy, and poliosis of one lash, the left eye is phthisical. In view of the history of preceding surgery and the poliosis this is most likely a case of sympathetic Ophthalmia, but could also be a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada Syndrome. The final diagnosis can only be made by histological investigation. One should also suspect a malignant melanoma. Careful ultrasound examinations  are needed to rule out this possibility.

General Medical History: in 06/2011 acute myeloic leucemia (AML M4) with 126.000 leucocytes, coronary heart disease, cranial MRI without lesions, Hb 9.3 g/dl. In 10/2011 beginn of systemic therapy with Adriamycin, Cytrarabin, and Mitoxatron.

Ocular Medical History: in 01/2012 fast reduction of VA at OS after systemic therapy over three weeks with meropenem (Meronem®, vancomycin und linezolid (Zyvoxid®).
Main Complaint: reduction of VA in OS.
Findings:
1) Colour Photography: bilateral optic nerve atrophy (OS>OD).
2) VEP: decreased amplitudes und prolonged latencies.
3) OCT: decreased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness.
Discussion:
It was reported (1,2), that antibiotic therapy with Linezolid (Zyvoxid®) can cause optic nerve atrophy. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, used against infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may lead to progressive, potentially irreversible neuropathies of the optic nerve especially in long-time application.
Linezolid is part of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal initiation complex. Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

Discussion: 
Arterial hypertension may cause cerebral, renal, cardiac and retinal end-organ damage. Hypertensive optic neuropathy and optic disk edema leads to hypoxia at the optic nerve head producing proximal axoplasmic flow stasis and secondary axonal swelling. Retinal hypertensive abnormalities are correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease in general but are not included in cardio vascular risk assessment tools. Kolman et al. (1) evaluated the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy and the association with other signs of end-organ-damage in 280 patients with arterial  hypertension. He found, that in 44% of patients referred to the clinic were diagnosed with hypertensive retinopathy, while 15 and 11% were diagnosed with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy LVH and microalbuminuria, respectively. Patients with isolated hypertensive retinopathy  consisted of 31% of all patients. When hypertensive retinopathy was added as a form of end-organ-damage , the percentage of patients with a treatment indication increased from 3 to 14%.

Optic neuropathies in HIV patients are caused by a variety of pathologies including infectious, compressive and inflammatory processes.

The pathogenesis of neuronal damage has been ascribed to the combined effect of neurotoxic agents including viral proteins and neurotoxic factors released from activated microglia and macrophages. 
Mwanza et al. (1) found, that VEPs were abnormal in 57% and 42% of HIV infected patients with and without neurological symptoms. HIV positive patients with neurological symptoms are not at higher risk for optic nerve damage than those without neurological manifestations. This support the hypothesis according to which axonal loss of the optic nerve is a common process occurring in all HIV infected subjects. 
There is evidence suggesting that, despite normal visual acuity, HIV infected subjects may have subclinical dysfunction of the optic nerves/retrochiasmal visual pathways that can be detected using electrophysiological methods.
A loss of cortical neurons has been found in asymptomatic HIV positive subjects in early stages of the infection. These lesions as well as others affecting the retrogeniculate part of the visual pathways, especially the primary visual cortex, may result in delay in both cortical processing and signal generation and thus in VEP abnormalities.

Discussion:
Optic neuropathies in HIV patients are caused by a variety of pathologies including infectious, compressive and inflammatory processes. There is evidence that the optic nerves of HIV infected patients can undergo chronic degeneration resulting in axonal loss. The current widely accepted theory emphasises the key role of tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) in the genesis of primary HIV optic neuropathy. The pathogenesis of neuronal damage has been ascribed to the combined effect of neurotoxic agents including viral proteins and neurotoxic factors released from activated microglia and macrophages. 
Mwanza et al. (1) found, that VEPs were abnormal in 57% and 42% of HIV infected patients with and without neurological symptoms. HIV positive patients with neurological symptoms are not at higher risk for optic nerve damage than those without neurological manifestations. This support the hypothesis according to which axonal loss of the optic nerve is a common process occurring in all HIV infected subjects. 
There is evidence suggesting that, despite normal visual acuity, HIV infected subjects may have subclinical dysfunction of the optic nerves/retrochiasmal visual pathways that can be detected using electrophysiological methods.
A loss of cortical neurons has been found in asymptomatic HIV positive subjects in early stages of the infection. These lesions as well as others affecting the retrogeniculate part of the visual pathways, especially the primary visual cortex, may result in delay in both cortical processing and signal generation and thus in VEP abnormalities.

On confrontational visual fields, a defect was detected and prompted a formal visual field.  The left homonymous hemianopia was revealed at that time. 

A hemianopia can be congruous or complete. In this case, the image reveals a complete left hemianopia. A temporal crescent is absent, this tells us the lesion is likely to be occipital. Macular sparing is absent, this tells us the lesion is likely to be occipital. This lesion points to a parietal lesion, which can be confirmed with OKN asymmetry (pursuit problems to the side of the lesion). 

Complete hemianopias localizes the lesion retrochiasmal, but they cannot tell us where the lesion is present. The lesion can be present in the optic tract, optic radiations of parietal lobe or occipital cortex. Cogan's Dictum can help us localize the lesion.

Cogan's Dictum states:
1. Homonymous hemianopia plus asymmetric OKN=likely mass lesion, parietal lobe
2. Homonymous hemianopia plus symmetric OKN= likely vascular infarction, occipital lobe

Discussion
Meyer's loop, the most vulnerable part of the optic radiations during approaches to the temporomedial region, extends to the tip of the temporal horn and is often encountered in epilepsy surgery. The risk of damaging Meyer's loop during transsylvian selective amygdalohippocampectomy peaks while accessing the temporal horn through its roof by opening the inferior limiting sulcus of the insula (1). Selective amygdalohippocampectomy (SelAH) is increasingly performed in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. It was reported (2) that most of the patients who had undergone SelAH had homonymous superior quadrantic visual field defects contralateral to the side of the surgery.

Discussion:
It is recognized that significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss occurs in MS patients following optic neuritis. A reduction in RGC may be identified earlier due to transient edema in the acute stage of ON masking any early RNFL loss. Several recent studies (1, 2) have suggested that RGC layer thinning is a good measure of disease-related visual and general disability and brain atrophy. Ocular manifestations of Von Recklinghausen disease are frequent and can reveal the disease. Benchekroun O et al. (3) examined 11 patients with Neurofibromatosis during two years. He suggested that an ophthalmologic examination must always be performed if Von Recklinghausen is suspected.

Colour Photography Posterior Segment:  optic nerve atrophy in OD and OS.
SD-OCT : decreased thickness of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer in nasal and temporal area, OD>OS.
SD-OCT :  homonymous thinning of of retinal ganglion cell layer in OD and OS nasal, temporal, superior, and inferior to the fovea corresponding to homonymous visual field field defect.
Visual Field: homonymous field defect in OD and OS.
MRI: after partial tumor resection extensive defect area with surrounding gliosis in the left temporal and occipital lobes involving the left optic radiation.   

Discussion:
It is recognized that significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss occurs in MS patients following optic neuritis. A reduction in RGC may be identified earlier due to transient edema in the acute stage of ON masking any early RNFL loss. Several recent studies (1, 2) have suggested that RGC layer thinning is a good measure of disease-related visual and general disability and brain atrophy. Ocular manifestations of Von Recklinghausen disease are frequent and can reveal the disease. Benchekroun O et al. (3) examined 11 patients with Neurofibromatosis during two years. He suggested that an ophthalmologic examination must always be performed if Von Recklinghausen is suspected.

Ocular medical history: Exotropy of OD, BCVA with CL 0.8 at OD;. Vision improved from 0.6 to 0.8 with wear of contact lenses.
General Medical History: empty
Main complaint: decrease of vision at OD, glasses showed no improvement of vision at OD.
Purpose: to show unilateral keratoconus suspect without any slit-lamp findings causing decreased vision.
Methods: Colour Photography, Tomey Topography.
Findings:
Colour Slit Lamp Photography: no visible corneal stromal thinning, no conical protrusion of the cornea at the apex, no Fleischer ring, no Vogt striae, and no anterior corneal stromal scar.
Corneal topography: showing an area of inferior steepening combined with an oblique cylinder >4 diopters and steep keratometric curvature greater than 47 D.
Discussion:
Corneal topography pattern recognition combined with quantitative diagnostic indices is useful for the screening of keratoconus (KC). KC is a noninflammatory progressive corneal disease characterized by localized conical protrusion, apical thinning, irregular astigmatism, and central scarring in the cornea. Keratoconus and other forms of corneal ectasias may be considered as a spectrum of primary corneal ectasia. The prevalence of KC is approximately one per 2,000 in the general population. Lim et al. (1) characterized keratoconus suspect (1) by corneal topography showing an area of central, inferior, or superior steepening combined with any of the following: oblique cylinder >1.5 diopters (D); steep keratometric curvature greater than 47 D, or central corneal thickness less than 500 μm, but without any slit-lamp findings.

Patient: 13 years of age, male, BCVA 0.4 at OD, 0.9 at OS.
General Medical History: new onset, single episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure , MRI showed unclear cerebral tumor.
Ocular Medical History: up to the time of presentation no subjective problems with vision.

Purpose: to show bitemporal and diffuse optic nerve atrophy in suspected central neurocytoma after a new onset, single episode of generalized seizure.
       
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, SD-OCT, Visual Field, cMRI.
Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: regular optic nerve head in OD and OS.
SD-OCT: diffuse and temporally decreased retinal nerve fiber thickness in OD>OS
Visual Field: hemianopsia at OD, complete visual field defect at OS. 
Cranial MRI: Coronal T1-weighted and (B) sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance images showing  cystic frontobasal and suprasellar lesion with intra- and extraventricular parts with increased T2-signal, no contrast media uptake and no diffusion restriction. Only slight perifocal edema. The maximal extent is 68 x 43 x 58 mm. In summary, this lesion is most likely a central neurocytoma.
Discussion: 
Homonymous hemianopia is usually secondary to stroke, head trauma, and tumors. The characteristics of visual field defects can be helpful in lesion location. Zhang X et al. (1) described the clinical characteristics and clinical-anatomic correlations of homonymous hemianopia. He found that  causes of homonymous hemianopia included stroke (69%), trauma (13%), tumor (11%), brain surgery (2%),  and demyelination (1%). The lesions were most commonly located in the occipital lobes (45%) and the optic radiations (32.2%). Neurocytomas (2, 3) are rare central nervous system tumors in intraventricular sites, in the brain and spinal cord parenchyma. Cerebral neurocytomas are histologically low-grade tumors and radical surgery is curative.

Discussion: In general pits of the optic nerve head (OPD) are oval cavities or depressions in the optic disc. Itis a herniation of dysplastic retinal tissue into a collagen rich excavation extending into the subarachnoid space through a defect in the lamina cribrosa.  Pits of the optic nerve can appear as a localized pit-like invagination in the optic disc. They can be congenital or acquired. ODPs can remain clinically asymptomatic in many cases. In about 50% patients with ODPs develop optic disc pit related maculopathy with retinoschisis, atrophy of inner retinal layers, serous macular detachment and significant loss of vision. 1-2

General Medical History: two months before, in Nov 2013 acute infarction of posterior cerebral artery, long standing arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: regular pseudophakia.
Main Complaint: altered visual field to the left side.
Purpose: to demonstrate complete visual field defect to the left side after posterior cerebral artery infarction.
Methods: Colour Photography, SD-OCT (Heidelberg Engineering), ww-Perimetry (Octopus G1), MRT (Siemens, TimTrio). 
Colour Photography OD& OS: pale optic nerve head (OD>OS), no cupping.
OCT OD& OS : minimal diffuse thinning of retinal nerve fiber layer.
ww-Perimetry OD& OS : complete homonymus visual defect to the left side.
MRI: in 11/2013 complete infarction of posterior cerebral artery (T1) (star).
MRI-DTI: in 01/2014 decreased axonal integrity in posterior part of optic radiation (arrow). 
Discussion: Homonymous hemianopia is an anisotropic visual impairment with the binocular inability to see one side of the visual field. Patients with homonymous hemianopia often misperceive visual space and are not allowed to drive due to legal restrictions regarding the minimum size of the visual field. It is a common consequence of postchiasmic damage to the visual cortex due to cerebrovascular strokes on one side of the brain. Cardiac embolism and intrinsic PCA atherosclerotic disease has been shown to be the leading stroke mechanism of posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction. Lee et al. (1) reported that large artery atherosclerosis (LAA, 42.4%) was the most frequent etiology, followed by cardiogenic embolism (20%), small-vessel occlusion (20%), undetermined (18%) and other determined (3%) etiology. Finelli (2) commented, that the role of neuroimaging in acute posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory infarction is less well appreciated compared with the anterior cerebral circulation because PCA infarction occurs less frequently and more often is associated with limited neurologic deficit not qualifying for thrombolytic therapy. However, visual field defect accompanies PCA infarction would warrant thrombolytic therapy.

Discussion:
Idiopathic macular telangiectasia type 2 (Mac Tel 2) is an acquired bilateral neurodegenerative macular disease. Based on current imaging modalities, Mac Tel 2 appears to be a primary neuroretinal degenerative condition with a secondary vascular involvement. Gass and Oyakawa (1) classified idiopathic juxtafoveolar retinal telangiectasis into four groups. Group 1 is characterized by unilateral parafoveal retinal telangiectasis associated with lipid and serous retinal exudation. Group 2 patients were mostly men with bilateral symmetric juxtafoveolar telangiectasis affecting the temporal half of the juxtafoveolar areas with minimal intraretinal exudation. Group 3 included eyes in both males and females that had bilateral parafoveolar telangiectasis with minimal intraretinal exudation, bilateral easily visible telangiectasis, and capillary occlusion. Group 4 referred to cases with familial optic disc pallor and perifoveolar retinal capillary occlusion. Wu et al. published an overview (2). He stated, that pathogenesis remains unclear. Müller cells and macular pigment appear to play a central role. The disease usually manifests itself during the fourth to sixth decades of life. Long-term prognosis for central vision is variable and depends on the development of SRNV or macular atrophy. Currently there is no known treatment for the underlying cause of this condition, but treatment of the SRNV may be beneficial.

Patient: 67 years of age, BVCA 0.3 at OD, 0.6 at OS, IOP 16/18 mmHg. 
General Medical History: arterial hypertension.
Ocular Medical History: decreased vision in OD.
Main Complaint: unclear vision loss.
Purpose: to present peripherial ischemic retinopathy in mainly regular central fundus.
Methods: Colour Photogaphy Posterior Segment, Optical Coherence Tomography, Fundus Fluorescein Angiography.  
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: nonperfused segment in superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, few intraretinal hemorrhages, no nerve fiber layer infarcts, no optic disc edema.
Fluorescein angiography (FA): nonperfused segment of superior temporal vein with collateral vessels, peripherial retinal neovascularisation, peripheral capillary nonperfusion with more than 10 disc diameters of retinal capillary nonperfusion.
Optical coherence tomography (OCT): decrease in foveal thickness, impaired inner segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, no macular swelling, no macular edema.
Discussion: 
Retinal vein occlusion (RVO) is the second most common cause after diabetic retinopathy of vision loss due to retinal vascular disease. Branch vein occlusion (BRVO) is about 3-6 times more common than central vein occlusion (CRVO). Ho et al. (1) reported, that pooled data showed prevalence rates of about 0.52% for any RVO, 0.44% for BRVO, and 0.08% for CRVO. BRVO is caused by a combination of vein compression at arteriovenous crossings, degenerative changes within venous walls, and hypercoagulability. 34% of nonischemic retinal vein occlusion converted to the ischemic type. Kokolaki et al. (2) showed, that collateral vessels developed in 60% of patients 6±3 months after diagnosis.

Ocular Medical History: in 2003 Laser-assisted in Situ Keratomileusis, in 2014 ocular blunt trauma with flap dislocation, and epithelial cell growth into the interface, in 2014 two flap-lift retreatments with surgical flap reposition,  good visual recovery.
Purpose: to visualize corneal structural changes and epithelial ingrowth in a young male patient after a blunt trauma with LASIK flap dislocation  after LASIK 11 years ago. 
Methods:  Colour Photography Anterior Segment, Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SL-OCT), Topography (Tomey)) 
Findings:
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: Focal area of epithelial ingrowth.
SL-OCT: epithelial ingrowth underneath the flap, no flap stromal edema.
Topography: irregular astigmatism.
Discussion:
Interface complications include infectious keratitis, diffuse lamellar keratitis, central toxic keratopathy, pressure-induced stromal keratopathy (PISK), and epithelial ingrowth. Güell J et al. (1) reported a low incidence of epithelial ingrowth after regular LASIK. From a total of 7520 LASIK refractive eyes, 13 eyes with epithelial ingrowth were treated. Randleman JB  et al. (2) described epithelial ingrowth as a LASIK interface complication. Epithelial ingrowth is easily distinguishable from other interface complications and may be self-limited or require flap lift to treat irregular astigmatism and prevent flap melt.

Discussion
Differentiating ischemic CRVO from nonischemic CRVO is crucial. Fluorescein fundus angiography during the early acute phase of CRVO provided reliable information about retinal capillary nonperfusion in approximately 60% of cases.  Visual outcome is good in nonischemic CRVO and poor in ischemic CRVO. Hayreh (1) suggested, that a clear differentiation of CRVO into nonischemic and ischemic types, based primarily on functional criteria, is fundamental in determining visual outcome. He reported that visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 78% with nonischemic CRVO and in only 1% with ischemic CRVO. Final visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 83% with nonischemic CRVO and in only 12% with ischemic CRVO. Of 100% eyes with nonischemic CRVO, about 10% converted to the ischemic type. Hayreh reported, that there was a higher prevalence of history of cerebrovascular disease in those that converted from nonischemic to ischemic CRVO. Most CRVO eyes start as nonischemic and some convert later to ischemic CRVO.

Discussion:
Idiopathic macular telangiectasia type 2 (Mac Tel 2) is an acquired bilateral neurodegenerative macular disease. Based on current imaging modalities, Mac Tel 2 appears to be a primary neuroretinal degenerative condition with a secondary vascular involvement. Gass and Oyakawa (1) classified idiopathic juxtafoveolar retinal telangiectasis into four groups. Group 1 is characterized by unilateral parafoveal retinal telangiectasis associated with lipid and serous retinal exudation. Group 2 patients were mostly men with bilateral symmetric juxtafoveolar telangiectasis affecting the temporal half of the juxtafoveolar areas with minimal intraretinal exudation. Group 3 included eyes in both males and females that had bilateral parafoveolar telangiectasis with minimal intraretinal exudation, bilateral easily visible telangiectasis, and capillary occlusion. Group 4 referred to cases with familial optic disc pallor and perifoveolar retinal capillary occlusion. Wu et al. published an overview (2). He stated, that pathogenesis remains unclear. Müller cells and macular pigment appear to play a central role. The disease usually manifests itself during the fourth to sixth decades of life. Long-term prognosis for central vision is variable and depends on the development of SRNV or macular atrophy. Currently there is no known treatment for the underlying cause of this condition, but treatment of the SRNV may be beneficial.

___Discussion:  In presented case the increased foveolar avascular zone and the rarefication of macular capillaries  in OD may be caused by the venous vascular dysregulation, and glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy. Glaucoma is a chronic, progressive optic neuropathy with optic nerve deterioration, visual field defects, and vascular dysregulation and rarefication. Müller et al. and Zivkovicet al. investigated macular capillaries in glaucoma by OCT-angiography. Zivkovic M et al. (2) measured foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in NTG and healthy subjects. He reported that mean horizontal, mean vertical diameter, and FAZ area were significantly enlarged in the NTG group. Müller et al. (1)  investigated central macular microvasculature in glaucoma patients. He found in perimetric glaucoma patients significantly reduced density maps of superficial foveal flow.

Discussion:
Jonas et al (1) described morphological optic nerve head variables to classify glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Thus, glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy is classified by morphologic changes in the intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer: size and shape of the optic disc; size, shape and pallor of the neuroretinal rim; size of the optic cup in relation to the area of the disc; configuration and depth of the optic cup; cup-to-disc diameter ratio and cup-to-disc area ratio; presence and location of splinter-shaped haemorrhages; occurrence, size, configuration and location of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy; diffuse and/or focal decrease of the diameter of the retinal arterioles; and visibility of the retinal nerve fibre layer. Assessment of these variables is useful for the detection of glaucomatous optic nerve damage, and to differentiate various types of optic nerve atrophy. He suggested, that highest diagnostic power had the vertical cup-to-disc diameter ratio corrected for its dependence on the optic disc size, total neuroretinal rim area, rim-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size, and cup-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size. Oliveira C et al (2) using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope found a mean optic disc size in white subjects of 1.97+-0.6 mm².

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, HRT, OCT, FDT, ww-Perimetry
Findings:
(a) Ophthalmoscopy: optic disc size is increased, neuroretinal rim shape follows ISNT rule, no pallor;  size of the optic cup is not increased in relation to the area of the disc; no splinter-shaped haemorrhages; no parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy.
(b) HRT: optic disc size 2,9 mm² at OD, 2,8 mm² at OS; neuroretinal rim area size regular with 1.2 mm² at OD, 1.3 mm² at OS; neuroretinal rim area shape follows ISNT rule. The size of the optic cup is not increased in relation to the area of the disc (OD: area C/D-ratio 0,41, linear C/D-ratio 0.64, OS: area C/D-ratio 0.5, linear C/D-ratio 0.71).

(e ) Ww-perimetry: regular, no scotomas. 
Discussion:
Jonas et al (1) described morphological optic nerve head variables to classify glaucomatous optic neuropathy. Thus, glaucomatous optic nerve atrophy is classified by morphologic changes in the intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head and the retinal nerve fiber layer: size and shape of the optic disc; size, shape and pallor of the neuroretinal rim; size of the optic cup in relation to the area of the disc; configuration and depth of the optic cup; cup-to-disc diameter ratio and cup-to-disc area ratio; presence and location of splinter-shaped haemorrhages; occurrence, size, configuration and location of parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy; diffuse and/or focal decrease of the diameter of the retinal arterioles; and visibility of the retinal nerve fibre layer. Assessment of these variables is useful for the detection of glaucomatous optic nerve damage, and to differentiate various types of optic nerve atrophy. He suggested, that highest diagnostic power had the vertical cup-to-disc diameter ratio corrected for its dependence on the optic disc size, total neuroretinal rim area, rim-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size, and cup-to-disc area ratio corrected for disc size. Oliveira C et al (2) using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope found a mean optic disc size in white subjects of 1.97+-0.6 mm².

Discussion:
Choroideremia (CHM) is an X-linked retinal dystrophy belonging to the family of blinding disorders. It is characterized by progressive degeneration of the choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors. CHM is caused by mutations in the Rab Escort Protein 1 (REP-1) gene, which encodes a protein involved in vesicular trafficking (1). Complete deletion of the CHM gene causes severe choroideremia. Mura et al. (2) presented results of serial ERGs documenting progression first of rod and then of cone disease.

Discussion:
Idiopathic macular telangiectasia type 2 (Mac Tel 2) is an acquired bilateral neurodegenerative macular disease. Based on current imaging modalities, Mac Tel 2 appears to be a primary neuroretinal degenerative condition with a secondary vascular involvement. Gass and Oyakawa (1) classified idiopathic juxtafoveolar retinal telangiectasis into four groups. Group 1 is characterized by unilateral parafoveal retinal telangiectasis associated with lipid and serous retinal exudation. Group 2 patients were mostly men with bilateral symmetric juxtafoveolar telangiectasis affecting the temporal half of the juxtafoveolar areas with minimal intraretinal exudation. Group 3 included eyes in both males and females that had bilateral parafoveolar telangiectasis with minimal intraretinal exudation, bilateral easily visible telangiectasis, and capillary occlusion. Group 4 referred to cases with familial optic disc pallor and perifoveolar retinal capillary occlusion. Wu et al. published an overview (2). He stated, that pathogenesis remains unclear. Müller cells and macular pigment appear to play a central role. The disease usually manifests itself during the fourth to sixth decades of life. Long-term prognosis for central vision is variable and depends on the development of SRNV or macular atrophy. Currently there is no known treatment for the underlying cause of this condition, but treatment of the SRNV may be beneficial.

Idiopathic macular telangiectasia type 2 (Mac Tel 2) is an acquired bilateral neurodegenerative macular disease. Based on current imaging modalities, Mac Tel 2 appears to be a primary neuroretinal degenerative condition with a secondary vascular involvement. Gass and Oyakawa (1) classified idiopathic juxtafoveolar retinal telangiectasis into four groups. Group 1 is characterized by unilateral parafoveal retinal telangiectasis associated with lipid and serous retinal exudation. Group 2 patients were mostly men with bilateral symmetric juxtafoveolar telangiectasis affecting the temporal half of the juxtafoveolar areas with minimal intraretinal exudation. Group 3 included eyes in both males and females that had bilateral parafoveolar telangiectasis with minimal intraretinal exudation, bilateral easily visible telangiectasis, and capillary occlusion. Group 4 referred to cases with familial optic disc pallor and perifoveolar retinal capillary occlusion. Wu et al. published an overview (2). He stated, that pathogenesis remains unclear. Müller cells and macular pigment appear to play a central role. The disease usually manifests itself during the fourth to sixth decades of life. Long-term prognosis for central vision is variable and depends on the development of SRNV or macular atrophy. Currently there is no known treatment for the underlying cause of this condition, but treatment of the SRNV may be beneficial.

Discussion
Fuchs' corneal dystrophy - a dominantly inherited disorder -  is a slowly progressive, bilateral corneal dystrophy that affects corneal endothelial cells. 
Cataract surgery is a risk factor for corneal endothelial cell loss. Corneal endothelial cell loss, a major complication that sometimes occurs after cataract surgery, can lead to corneal edema and decompensation if cell density falls to 500 cells/mm2 or below. Yamazoe et al (1) reported that the mean rate of endothelial cell loss is about 12% ± 23%.  Seitzman  et al (2) reported a series of patients with Fuchs' dystrophy (136 eyes) undergoing cataract surgery. The average preoperative corneal thickness ranged from 482 to 674 µm. 37% had preoperative corneal thickness of 600 µm or thicker. Of eyes with preoperative pachymetry measurements of 600 µm or thicker, 10% progressed to penetrating keratoplasty. Patients with a preoperative corneal thickness of >640 μm had a 22.2% rate of requiring a corneal transplant. Their data suggest that current cataract removal techniques allow for excellent visual rehabilitation in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy who have a preoperative corneal thickness lower than 600 µm. They recommend a concurrent penetrating keratoplasty with cataract surgery in patients with Fuchs' dystrophy and a corneal thickness of >640 μm.

Main complaint: diplopia and conjunctival chemosis.
Purpose: to present findings of an orbital apex syndrome in Graves disease. 
Methods: 
Facial Colour Photography, Visual Evoked Potential, Magnetic Resonance (MR) Imaging , visual field 90°, OCT optic nerve head.
Findings:
Facial  Colour Image:  strabism, conjunctival chemosis.
VEP: impaired amplitude and latency at OD.
Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging :  at both eyes apical orbital crowding  with enlargement of of extraocular muscles, spindle like spreading of the rectus muscles without involvement of the tendon,  compression of the optic nerve in the orbital apex (crowded orbital apex syndrome), and absence of any space occupying intraorbital process. 
Visual field 90°: peripherial scotoma at OD, regular field at OS
OCT optic nerve head: showing no edema of optic nerve head of OD.
Discussion
Endocrine orbitopathy (EO) or Graves' orbitopathy (GO) represents the most frequent extrathyroidal stigma of Graves disease. EO (GO) is a chronic autoimmune condition involving the orbital contents, including extraocular muscles, periorbital connective-fatty tissue and lacrimal gland. The increase of fat tissue and the enlargement of extraocular muscles leads to proptosis and diplopia. In severe cases EO (GO) leads  to optic neuropathy, caused by compression and stretching of the optic nerve. The congestion and the pressure of the enlarged muscles, constrict the nerve and can lead to reduced sight or loss of vision. Neigel et al. (1) reported that dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease; when compared with the usual Graves' orbitopathy patient. Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group. They found, that the most sensitive indicator of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visual-evoked potentials and color vision. These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients. Imaging and functional nerve evaluation are mandatory in all cases of EO. Müller-Forell W et al. (2) suggested, that neuroimaging plays an important role in the differential diagnosis  of patients with GO. Orbital imaging is required in unclear or asymmetric proptosis, in suspected optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging show the actual objective morphological findings.

Colour photography, March 2013: presenting an unilateral optic nerve atrophy with a pale rim at OS.

Discussion:
The visual loss in presented case may be attributed to involvement of the intracanalicular or orbital apical segment of the optic nerve. Extension of sphenoethmoiditis into the orbital apex may result in visual loss, but minimal signs of orbital pathology such as proptosis, chemosis, or lid edema. Patients with symptomatic acute sphenoethmoiditis involving the posterior ethmoid and/or sphenoid sinuses are at a high risk of permanent visual loss. Ergene  et al. (1) reported the frequency of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes on brain magnetic resonance imaging obtained from 23 patients with new onset acute optic neuritis. He found, that the distribution of paranasal sinus inflammatory changes in optic neuritis was maxillary 83%, ethmoid 4%, frontal 9%, and sphenoid 4%.

2) VEP: decreased amplitudes und prolonged latencies.

Discussion:
It was reported (1,2), that antibiotic therapy with Linezolid (Zyvoxid®) can cause optic nerve atrophy. Linezolid, an oxazolidinone, used against infections with methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) may lead to progressive, potentially irreversible neuropathies of the optic nerve especially in long-time application.
Linezolid is part of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 70S ribosomal initiation complex. Although this complex is not present in mammalian cells, a study has demonstrated reduced mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme activity in a patient receiving linezolid therapy who developed optic neuropathy, suggesting that mammalian mitochondria are vulnerable. Linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy may be similar to the respiratory chain dysfunction observed in mitochondrial optic neuropathies (e.g., Leber hereditary optic neuropathy). Coadministration of ciprofloxacin or rifampicin may potentiate the toxicity of linezolid. 
In general the functions of the eye can be disturbed by pharmaceutical agents via various mechanisms. Especially antimicrobial agents can produce ocular adverse drug reactions. The complexity of ocular adverse drug reactions underlines the need for a close interdisciplinary cooperation to optimize drug safety of antimicrobial agents.

Ocular Medical History: acute blurry vision in the right eye.
General Medical History: Arterial hypertension with blood pressure of 240/ 160 mmHg.
Purpose: to present hypertensive choroidopathy with Elschnig spots in arterial hypertension.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT, Indocyanine Green Angiography.
Findings: 
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots), retinal edema, narrowed arterioles, arterio-venous crossing, no retinal hemorrhages.
Indocyanine Green Angiography, after 2 min: multifocal areas with choriocapillaris non-perfusion.

OCT: focal thickening of retinal nerve fiber layer, intraretinal irregularities, no serous retinal detachment.
Discussion: Ocular manifestations of systemic hypertension are common and result in vascular compromise at the level of the retina, the choroid, or the optic nerve. Hypertensive choroidopathy is caused by fibrinoid necrosis of the choroidal arterioles. Hypertensive choroidopathy is characterized by hypoperfusion of the choriocapillaris, break down of the retinal pigment epithelial cells, and hypopigmented lesions (Elschnig spots). Hypertensive choroidopathy is a complication of systemic hypertension and can be the harbinger of a life-threatening hypertensive emergency.

Discussion: Ocular coloboma is a common malformation. It includes a spectrum of anomalies that ranges from iris coloboma to clinical anophthalmos. Coloboma is etiologically heterogeneous. The spectrum  can vary from small colobomas located in the equatorial region that do not interfere with vision, to large colobomas involving the disc and macula with severe impairment of vision. Choroidal coloboma is a congenital defect caused by defective closure of embryonal fissure, which normally takes place during the 6th week of gestation. As an isolated defect, it is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder, although autosomal recessive inheritance also occurs (1, 3). Gopal L et al. (2) described choroidal colobomas. Genetic as well as environmental causes have been proposed to cause an intrauterine insult that can lead to defective closure of the embryonal fissure leading to coloboma of the fundus (3). Histologically, the colobomatous area is deficient in normal choroid, retinal pigment epithelium, and the retina.

Discussion:
It was shown by Liu et al. (1) that progression and regression of DR were strongly associated with blood pressure and glycemic exposure.  In a huge study they investigated the progression and regression of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the effects of population risk factors on the rates of transition across retinopathy stages. From 1990 to 2011   4,758 diabetic patients who were diagnosed at 35 years of age or older were observed. They found a consistent risk effect of HbA1c on the progression  from no retinopathy to mild background DR a hazard ratio per SD of HbA1c  of 1.42, from mild BDR to observable BDR a hazard ratio of 1.32, and from observable BDR to severe nonproliferative/proliferative DR a hazard ratio of 2.23. Similarly, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure increased the risk for the transition from the asymptomatic phase to mild BDR  with a hazard ratio of 1.20 and from the mild BDR to observable BDR with a hazard ratio of 1.87, respectively. Regression from mild BDR to no DR was associated with lower SBP and lower HbA1c .

Discussion:
Conjunctival intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a frequent conjunctival tumor with an incidence of 1 to 2,8 per 100.000 subjects per year.  Following excision alone recurrences are frequent. An effective postsurgical recurrence prevention is therefore highly desirable. Cartsburg et al.(1) reported the effectivity of postsurgical chemotherapy of conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma in situ (CIN) with mitomycin C eyedrops. He found, that adjuvant topical mitomycin C appears to be effective in the prevention of recurrences of conjunctival CIN after surgical removal, and that at least 4 cycles of topical MMC are required to prevent local recurrences in the long term.

Discussion:
Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis is a highly contagious infection caused by adenovirus types 8, 19, and 37. The formation of subepithelial nummular infiltrates may lead to permanent visual disturbance. These infiltrates consist histopathologically of an accumulation of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and fibroblasts. The reasons for the persistence of these nummular infiltrates are not fully understood. It was reported (1) that nummuli can be identified as areas with an accumulation of dendritic cells (Langerhans cells) as well as punctiform structures located in the basal cell layer and in the region of the subepithelial nerve plexus.
Steroid therapy for persistent or recurrent nummular adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis has little benefit because of the frequent recurrences, and mostly ""offers"" only serious steroid side effects. Reinhard et al. (2) reported that topical CSA 2% 1-4 times daily is about as effective as topical steroids in the symptomatic treatment of non-scarred nummuli after epidemic keratoconjunctivitis without the serious steroid side effects. Topical CSA treatment of nummuli after epidemic keratoconjunctivitis seems to be a recommendable alternative for the potentially dangerous steroid therapy.

Patient:  72 years of age, male; BCVA OS 0.1, nuclear cataract.
Ocular medical history: deterioration of vision over two years, regular cataract surgery with small incision at February 4th 2013, no increase of BCVA in  February 27th 2013 due to cystoid macular edema.  Begin of therapy with oral carboanhydrase inhibitors (250mg/d), and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for three weeks.    
General medical history: rheumatoid arthritis, arterial hypertension.
Main complaint: lack of improvement of vision after cataract surgery. 
Purpose: to show improvement of cystoid macular edema within four weeks under oral carboanhydrase inhibitors and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.     
Method: Patient undergone spectralis-OCT before and after begin of therapy
Findings: 
OCT from February 27th 2013: cystoid macular edema with epiretinal membrane. 
OCT from March 25th 2013: no cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane.
Discussion: Suggested factors in CME after cataract surgery include hypotony, vitreous traction, and inflammation. There is the hypothesis, disruption of the BAB is a dominating factor in CME. It was suggested (1) that inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, which are biosynthesized by the anterior uvea and lens epithelial cells, are triggered by surgical trauma, leading to disruption of the BAB. As a result, various inflammatory mediators accumulate in the aqueous humor. The mediators are dispersed throughout the vitreous and increase the permeability of retinal vessels. The blood–retinal barrier (BRB) becomes disrupted, inducing CME over time. Predispositions to BAB and BRB disruption include aging, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and other diseases.
Data (2) suggest that the inflammatory mediators increase in the aqueous for 1 to 2 weeks after cataract and IOL surgery. 
It was shown (3), that topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) prevents the spike-like increase of flare, implying that NSAIDs are more effective than steroidal agents in preventing postoperative inflammation. Nepafenac was more effective than fluorometholone in preventing CME and BAB disruption and in providing early recovery of vision.

Discussion:
Almeida DR  et al. (1) studied spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction  in 61 patients. In 35% of 61 patients  developed a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. Isolated inner retinal distortion without outer retinal involvement was significantly associated with a spontaneous release of vitreomacular traction. CD45-positive cells were seen in epiretinal cell proliferation of eyes with macular pucker. These cells were suggested to be hyalocytes derived from the hematopoetic monocyte/macrophage lineage. Schumann RG  et al. (2) performed an electron microscopic study  and suggested a significant role of hyalocytes in epiretinal membrane formation.  Müller cells as principle glial cells in the neural retina  are responsible for scar formation and epiretinal gliosis. Activation of Müller cells including increased expression of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP) is a key response feature of age-related pathologies. GFAP is a protein biomarker activated by Müller cells and contributes to neuroregeneration including protease activation.  In a study Jünemann AG et  al. (3) found increased levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body of patients with epiretinal glioses and proposed that glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the vitreous body is a protein biomarker for glial response to retinal disorders.

Ocular Medical History: blurred vision at OS, salmon-colored subconjunctival lesion of the left eye consistent with an epibulbar lymphoma. After incisional biopsy and surgical tumor reduction a fractionnated stereotactical radiotherapy of left orbita inclusive left eye was performed with a total dose of 40 Gy (single dose of 2,0 Gy).
General Medical History: no relevant events, systemic lymphoma was absent. 
Major complaint: blurred vision at OS.
Purpose: to report the clinical, ultrasonographic, and histological features of choroidal lymphoma .

Methods: Colour Photography Anterior Segment, Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT, Ultrasound, Histology.

Findings:
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: transscleral epibulbar (extraocular) extension, visible as a pink mass under the conjunctiva and tenon fascia.
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: multifocal creamy-yellow infiltrates at the level of choroid.
Optical coherence tomography: irregular choroidal contour over the area of choroidal infiltration, subretinal fluid involving more than 1 quadrant. 
B-scan ultrasonography: choroidal thickening with relative acoustic hollowness and focal areas of posterior epibulbar extension, maximum tumor thickness of 2.6 mm. 
Histology:  Hematoxylin-eosin, subepithelial small, monomorphic lymphoid cells.

Discussion:
Proliferation of lymphoid cells in the uveal tract is rare. The presence of multifocal creamy-yellow patches at the level of choroid is probably the most helpful funduscopic feature for establishing the correct diagnosis of early choroidal lymphoma . Mashayekhi  A et al. concluded that patients with choroidal lymphoma, and no known systemic lymphoma at presentation should undergo systemic evaluation to rule out the possibility of undiagnosed concurrent systemic lymphoma. They found that the most common form of initial treatment was external beam radiotherapy, followed by some form of systemic treatment.

Island of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule were common postoperatively. A focal collection of lens epithelial cells on posterior capsule can mimic a glaucomatous visual field defect.

As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Patient: 30 years of age, female, BCVA 0.3 at OD, 0.8 at OS, IOP 15/16 mmHg, nystagmus, microstrabism with amblyopia at OD.
Ocular Medical History: ocular hypertension, trabeculotomy at OD & OS 10 years ago. 
General medical History: empty
Main Complaint: decreased vision at OD. 
Methods: Colour image, OCT.
Findings:
Anterior segment colour image of OS: Schwalbe‘s ring is seen as a central thickening and displacement of Schwalbe‘s line (arrows), visible with the slitlamp as an irregular white line just concentric to the limbus. At 3h the prominent Schwalbe‘s ring shows an attached iris strand (*) 
Optic nerve head colour image of OD&OS: no cupping, pale rim. 
OCT of OS: regular retinal nerve fiber thickness.
Ww-Perimetry:  Focal scotoma at OD with mean defect of 3.1 dB, no scotoma at OS.
Discussion:
Mesodermal abnormalities of the anterior segment include Axenfeld‘s anomaly and Rieger‘s anomaly. Axenfeld's anomaly shows a posterior embryotoxon. Posterior embryotoxon is a prominent Schwalbe's line that may be a partial or complete bilateral ring and is usually visible on gross external examination. It is an indication of either Axenfeld's anomaly/syndrome or Rieger's anomaly/syndrome, both of which are anterior chamber syndromes that put patients at risk for glaucoma.

Ocular Medical History: blurred vision at OS, salmon-colored subconjunctival lesion of the left eye consistent with an epibulbar lymphoma. After incisional biopsy and surgical tumor reduction a fractionnated stereotactical radiotherapy of left orbita inclusive left eye was performed with a total dose of 40 Gy (single dose of 2,0 Gy).
General Medical History: no relevant events, systemic lymphoma was absent. 
Major complaint: blurred vision at OS.
Purpose: to report the clinical, ultrasonographic, and histological features of choroidal lymphoma .

Methods: Colour Photography Anterior Segment, Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT, Ultrasound, Histology.

Findings:
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: transscleral epibulbar (extraocular) extension, visible as a pink mass under the conjunctiva and tenon fascia.
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: multifocal creamy-yellow infiltrates at the level of choroid.
Optical coherence tomography: irregular choroidal contour over the area of choroidal infiltration, subretinal fluid involving more than 1 quadrant. 
B-scan ultrasonography: choroidal thickening with relative acoustic hollowness and focal areas of posterior epibulbar extension, maximum tumor thickness of 2.6 mm. 
Histology:  Hematoxylin-eosin, subepithelial small, monomorphic lymphoid cells.

Discussion:
Proliferation of lymphoid cells in the uveal tract is rare. The presence of multifocal creamy-yellow patches at the level of choroid is probably the most helpful funduscopic feature for establishing the correct diagnosis of early choroidal lymphoma . Mashayekhi  A et al. concluded that patients with choroidal lymphoma, and no known systemic lymphoma at presentation should undergo systemic evaluation to rule out the possibility of undiagnosed concurrent systemic lymphoma. They found that the most common form of initial treatment was external beam radiotherapy, followed by some form of systemic treatment.

It occurs in immunocompetent patients, and can also be found in immunocompromised subjects. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV 1 and 2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been implicated in the etiology of ARN. The characteristic features  include iridocyclitis, vitritis, retinal necrosis, and retinal vasculitis with Kyrieleis’ vasculitis (2). Kyrieleis’ vasculitis is a condition in which white-yellowish exudates are placed in a beaded pattern within the retinal arteries. The diagnosis of ARN is usually based in clinical features. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in aqueous humor samples is useful to identify the etiology of the disease. The treatment of ARN includes intravenous acyclovir, corticosteroids and aspirin. To prevent fellow eye involvement, intravenous acyclovir is followed by oral acyclovir for 14 weeks. Alternatives to acyclovir include ganciclovir, foscarnet, famcyclovir, brivudine, and valgancyclovir.

General Medical History: kidney transplantion in 2001, taking oral cellsept, steroids immediately prior to presentation at 10.4.2016 with acute post transplant lymphoproliferative disease and deterioration of vision in OD.
Ocular Medical History: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis or acute retinal necrosis (ARN) was suspected at 10.4.2016. Cytomegali virus (CMV) was detected in the anterior chamber, intravenous course of acyclovir was initiated.
Purpose: to show effect of systemic therapy with acyclovir over 4 months in Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome in Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Retinitis.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, OCT.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole, initial finding: small Kyrieleis’ plaques within the arteries, retinal infiltration , retinal vasculitis, vitreous opacity, 
Colour Photography Posterior Pole, after 4 months of therapy with aciclovir:  retinal vasculitis with Kyrieleis’ plaques within mainly all arteries, retinal necrosis. 
OCT, after 4 months of therapy with aciclovir: retinal necrosis, Kyrieleis’ plaques within the arteries.

Discussion: Acute Retinal Necrosis Syndrome in CMV retinitis is typical for immuno-compromised patients. Bonfioli et al. (1) summarize d, that acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is an uncommon intraocular inflammatory syndrome characterized by severe and diffuse uveitis, retinal vasculitis, and retinal necrosis. It occurs in immunocompetent patients, and can also be found in immunocompromised subjects. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), herpes simplex virus (HSV 1 and 2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) have been implicated in the etiology of ARN. The characteristic features  include iridocyclitis, vitritis, retinal necrosis, and retinal vasculitis with Kyrieleis’ vasculitis (2). Kyrieleis’ vasculitis is a condition in which white-yellowish exudates are placed in a beaded pattern within the retinal arteries. The diagnosis of ARN is usually based in clinical features. The use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in aqueous humor samples is useful to identify the etiology of the disease. The treatment of ARN includes intravenous acyclovir, corticosteroids and aspirin. To prevent fellow eye involvement, intravenous acyclovir is followed by oral acyclovir for 14 weeks. Alternatives to acyclovir include ganciclovir, foscarnet, famcyclovir, brivudine, and valgancyclovir.

Discussion:
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss . As pharmaceutical agents blocking vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) were used ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), bevacizumab (Avastin, Genentech, South San Francisco, California, USA), or aflibercept (Eylea, Regeneron, Tarrytown, New Jersey). Recalcitrant exudative AMD is a substantial clinical burden, representing approximately a third of all new wet AMD eyes. Wykoff et al. reported (1), that despite monthly treatment with anti-VEGF agents for 2 years, about 51% of patients treated with ranibuzumab and about 67% of patients given bevacizumab showed evidence of persistent fluid. Similarly, in the VIEW1 and VIEW2 trials about 30% of patients had evidence of persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment. Wykoff et al. concluded in (1) that (a) 2.0 mg aflibercept treatment led to significant mean anatomic improvement, primarily driven by 20%  of the patients, and (b) aflibercept treatment may be anatomically valuable in some recalcitrant exudative AMD eyes.

Discussion: 
Arterial hypertension may cause cerebral, renal, cardiac and retinal end-organ damage. Hypertensive optic neuropathy and optic disk edema leads to hypoxia at the optic nerve head producing proximal axoplasmic flow stasis and secondary axonal swelling. Retinal hypertensive abnormalities are correlated with an increased risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease in general but are not included in cardio vascular risk assessment tools. Kolman et al. (1) evaluated the prevalence of hypertensive retinopathy and the association with other signs of end-organ-damage in 280 patients with arterial  hypertension. He found, that in 44% of patients referred to the clinic were diagnosed with hypertensive retinopathy, while 15 and 11% were diagnosed with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy LVH and microalbuminuria, respectively. Patients with isolated hypertensive retinopathy  consisted of 31% of all patients. When hypertensive retinopathy was added as a form of end-organ-damage , the percentage of patients with a treatment indication increased from 3 to 14%.

The abducens nerve is intact and functioning, however the lateral rectus is also partially innervated by the third cranial nerve. Thus, on adduction, both medial and lateral rectus muscles are activated and the eye is unable to adduct well. The globe also retracts, causing lid fissure narrowing. 

This patient has Duane’s syndrome in the right eye and has had unknown prior strabismus surgery (which improved his adduction) and has a small residual XT, seen in primary position. He exhibits decreased abduction on both right and left gaze (some of this is likely a sequelae of the prior surgery).

Ocular Medical History: blurred vision at OS, salmon-colored subconjunctival lesion of the left eye consistent with an epibulbar lymphoma. After incisional biopsy and surgical tumor reduction a fractionnated stereotactical radiotherapy of left orbita inclusive left eye was performed with a total dose of 40 Gy (single dose of 2,0 Gy).
General Medical History: no relevant events, systemic lymphoma was absent. 
Major complaint: blurred vision at OS.
Purpose: to report the clinical, ultrasonographic, and histological features of choroidal lymphoma .

Methods: Colour Photography Anterior Segment, Colour Photography Posterior Segment, OCT, Ultrasound, Histology.

Findings:
Colour Photography Anterior Segment: transscleral epibulbar (extraocular) extension, visible as a pink mass under the conjunctiva and tenon fascia.
Colour Photography Posterior Segment: multifocal creamy-yellow infiltrates at the level of choroid.
Optical coherence tomography: irregular choroidal contour over the area of choroidal infiltration, subretinal fluid involving more than 1 quadrant. 
B-scan ultrasonography: choroidal thickening with relative acoustic hollowness and focal areas of posterior epibulbar extension, maximum tumor thickness of 2.6 mm. 
Histology:  Hematoxylin-eosin, subepithelial small, monomorphic lymphoid cells.

Discussion:
Proliferation of lymphoid cells in the uveal tract is rare. The presence of multifocal creamy-yellow patches at the level of choroid is probably the most helpful funduscopic feature for establishing the correct diagnosis of early choroidal lymphoma . Mashayekhi  A et al. concluded that patients with choroidal lymphoma, and no known systemic lymphoma at presentation should undergo systemic evaluation to rule out the possibility of undiagnosed concurrent systemic lymphoma. They found that the most common form of initial treatment was external beam radiotherapy, followed by some form of systemic treatment.

Patient:  72 years of age, male; BCVA OS 0.1, nuclear cataract.
Ocular medical history: deterioration of vision over two years, regular cataract surgery with small incision at February 4th 2013, no increase of BCVA in  February 27th 2013 due to cystoid macular edema.  Begin of therapy with oral carboanhydrase inhibitors (250mg/d), and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs for three weeks.    
General medical history: rheumatoid arthritis, arterial hypertension.
Main complaint: lack of improvement of vision after cataract surgery. 
Purpose: to show improvement of cystoid macular edema within four weeks under oral carboanhydrase inhibitors and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.     
Method: Patient undergone spectralis-OCT before and after begin of therapy
Findings: 
OCT from February 27th 2013: cystoid macular edema with epiretinal membrane. 
OCT from March 25th 2013: no cystoid macular edema, epiretinal membrane.
Discussion: Suggested factors in CME after cataract surgery include hypotony, vitreous traction, and inflammation. There is the hypothesis, disruption of the BAB is a dominating factor in CME. It was suggested (1) that inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, which are biosynthesized by the anterior uvea and lens epithelial cells, are triggered by surgical trauma, leading to disruption of the BAB. As a result, various inflammatory mediators accumulate in the aqueous humor. The mediators are dispersed throughout the vitreous and increase the permeability of retinal vessels. The blood–retinal barrier (BRB) becomes disrupted, inducing CME over time. Predispositions to BAB and BRB disruption include aging, arterial hypertension, diabetes, and other diseases.
Data (2) suggest that the inflammatory mediators increase in the aqueous for 1 to 2 weeks after cataract and IOL surgery. 
It was shown (3), that topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) prevents the spike-like increase of flare, implying that NSAIDs are more effective than steroidal agents in preventing postoperative inflammation. Nepafenac was more effective than fluorometholone in preventing CME and BAB disruption and in providing early recovery of vision.

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm. 
Symptomatic choroidal metastases is a rare presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Choroidal metastases (CM) are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. CM is detected in 2% to 7% of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is generally discovered at the end-stage of the disease. Singh et al. (2) reported the demographic profile, histology, disease stage, ocular and lung lesions, diagnostic and treatment (systemic and ocular) modalities, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer : 67% of patients were male and 78% were current or ex-smokers, mean age was 55 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type followed by squamous and small cell. Bilateral involvement was rare (<10%). Ocular treatment modalities included radiation, enucleation, and systemic steroids. Regression of choroidal metastases with treatment was observed in 67% of patients who did not undergo enucleation.

Ocular Medical History: 12 months later development of cataract in both eyes with decreased visual acuity. 
Purpose: to present electrically induced cataract in both eyes induced by high voltage current.
Methods: Colour Photography Posterior Pole, VEP.
Findings:
Colour Photography Posterior Pole: cataractous changes with characteristic anterior subcapsular opacifications.
VEP: decreased amplitude in OS, regular amplitude in OD.
Discussion: 
Saffle et al. reviewed patients suffering major electrical injuries. Patients who suffered cataracts were injured with high (greater than 1,000-v) voltage current. All patients suffered true 'entrance and exit' wounds. Cataracts first presented as decreased visual acuity 1 to 12 months postinjury. Electrical cataracts remain a serious potential complication of electrical injury.

Discussion:
Choroidal metastases (CM), the commonest intraocular malignancy, are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. Autopsy studies (1) reported that 9% to 10% of patients who died of cancer had ocular metastasis, and most of them were localized in the choroid. CM occurs almost exclusively in metastatic disease, years after diagnosis of the primary neoplasm. 
Symptomatic choroidal metastases is a rare presenting manifestation of lung cancer. Choroidal metastases (CM) are metastatic lesions to the choroid layer of the eye. CM is detected in 2% to 7% of patients with metastatic lung cancer and is generally discovered at the end-stage of the disease. Singh et al. (2) reported the demographic profile, histology, disease stage, ocular and lung lesions, diagnostic and treatment (systemic and ocular) modalities, and treatment outcomes of 55 patients with choroidal metastases secondary to lung cancer : 67% of patients were male and 78% were current or ex-smokers, mean age was 55 years. Adenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type followed by squamous and small cell. Bilateral involvement was rare (<10%). Ocular treatment modalities included radiation, enucleation, and systemic steroids. Regression of choroidal metastases with treatment was observed in 67% of patients who did not undergo enucleation.

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

In POAG the loss of neuroretinal rim area per year could be very small. Mardin  (1) described, that a  glaucoma induced rim loss is very small per year and should be differentiated from regular age-related loss. The most pronounced loss in glaucoma  is temporal, both superior and inferior. Bengtsson et al (2) examined distributions of rates of progression from visual field series in pseudophakic eyes by Octopus perimeter (Haag Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland).

Main complaint: diplopia
Ocular medical history: uncomplicated cataract surgery at OD in 2009  
General medical history: arterial hypertension. 

Purpose: to present a 81-year-old Caucasian man with a history of arterial hypertension presented to the Department of Ophthalmology complaining of diplopia. He was found to have a large basilar artery aneurysm.

Methods: Ophthalmoscopy, neuro-ophthalmological examination, OCT, MRI.

Findings:
1) Ophthalmoscopy showed regular retina and optic nerve head.
2) OCT showing generalized thinning of retinal nerve fiber thickness
3) Neuro-ophthalmological examination depicted left sided trochlear nerve paresis with a vertical deviation of 3.5° leading to intermittened diplopia.  
4) MRI-Angiography: Imaging of the brain revealed a fusiform aneurysm of the proximal basilar artery with a diameter of 17 mm.

Discussion:
The visual pathways and the ocular motor cranial nerves are frequently injured by expanding cerebral aneurysms. Neuro-ophthalmologic signs and symptoms may be the only indications of an aneurysm prior to rupture. Acute or chronic visual loss may herald an aneurysm prior to rupture. Diplopia and retro-orbital pain may be warning signs that precede the discovery of a posterior communicating, basilar, or cavernous sinus aneurysm.
Dolichoectasia of intracranial arteries is a rare arteriopathy characterized by elongation and widening of the arteries and disturbance of the laminar blood flow. It involves mostly vertebral and basilar arteries. In advanced cases, formation of a fusiform aneurysm is possible. Intracranial arterial dolichoectasia may be asymptomatic for a long time. However, in many cases it leads to neurological symptoms associated with haemodynamic disturbance and mass effect caused by the widened vessel.(1)

General Medical History: Hashimoto thyreoditis.
Ocular Medical History: in 2005 parapapillary bleedings with regular visual fields, the 24h-IOP profiles were always 14-16 mmHg at OD and OS without any therapy, there was a regular cerebral MRI . 
Main complaint: parapapillary bleedings.
Purpose: to show transition from pre-perimetric to perimetric glaucoma  with a clear glaucomatous change in the optic nerve head over an interval of 7 years  from 2006 to 2013.
Methods: Fundus Colour Image, w-w-Perimetry  30° Octopus G1, SD-OCT Heidelberg Engineering.
Findings:
Colour fundus imaging: showing a structural progression of the optic nerve head over 7 years  from 2006 to 2013, depicting in 2013 a parapapillary hemorrhage at 11h with minor changes in the retinal pigment epithelium.
Visual field : showing minor changes in the visual fields from 2006 to 2007, and in 2008 a clear scotoma. Over 7 years there was a mean loss of 1,2 dB/year and a functional defect of -8.7% per year with an acceleration in the last 3 years.
SD-OCT: showing in 2008 a localized  defect at 7h, in 2013 a general atrophy and a deep defect at 7h of the retinal fiber layer. The retinal nerve fiber layer showed a decrease from 79 µm to 65 µma over 6 years.

Dicussion: 
In POAG the loss of neuroretinal rim area per year could be very small. Mardin  (1) described, that a  glaucoma induced rim loss is very small per year and should be differentiated from regular age-related loss. The most pronounced loss in glaucoma  is temporal, both superior and inferior. Bengtsson et al (2) examined distributions of rates of progression from visual field series in pseudophakic eyes by Octopus perimeter (Haag Streit AG, Koeniz, Switzerland). They found in glaucoma patients a mean loss of 2.7%/year with the mean defect index MDI.
